29952742|ab|1|29952742|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Youth with early onset schizophrenia (EOS) are eligible for an individualized education plan (IEP) in school settings, yet often have declining academic performance over time.
29952742|ab|2|29952742|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study examines the impact of IEP and comorbid conditions on educational outcomes for youth with EOS.
29952742|ab|3|29952742|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|We used mixed models and logistic regression to answer the research questions using data from 129 youth with EOS who participated in a longitudinal study from 1998 to 2006.
29952742|ab|4|29952742|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Not all children had an IEP in all waves.
29952742|ab|5|29952742|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Of those that did, findings demonstrated that having an IEP did not improve absenteeism or academic performance.
29952742|ab|6|29952742|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, regardless of whether they had an IEP, rates of dropping out were equal.
29952742|ab|7|29952742|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Social workers should consider more individualized approaches to IEPs for youth with EOS to target the specific complexities of the disorder as well as its implications for school success.
29953955|ab|1|29953955|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The electrophysiological features and roles of persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are not known.
29953955|ab|2|29953955|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The purpose of this study was to elucidate the electrophysiological features and roles of PLSVC in patients with SVT.
29953955|ab|3|29953955|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We included 37 patients with PLSVC (mean age 43.5 +/- 17.1 years; 35.1% men) and 510 patients without PLSVC (mean age 43.9 +/- 18.8 years; 48.2% men) who underwent an electrophysiology study for SVT.
29953955|ab|4|29953955|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The number of induced tachycardias, location of the slow pathway (SP) or accessory pathway (AP), and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) outcomes were compared between patients with and without PLSVC.
29953955|ab|5|29953955|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|During RFCA of the left AP, a coronary sinus (CS) catheter was placed into the left superior vena cava (left superior vena cava group) or the great cardiac vein (great cardiac vein group).
29953955|ab|6|29953955|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The RFCA outcomes were compared between the groups.
29953955|ab|7|29953955|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In patients with PLSVC, 40 tachycardias were induced: atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) (n = 19), atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (n = 17), and focal atrial tachycardia (n = 4).
29953955|ab|8|29953955|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Among patients with AVNRT, an SP in the CS was significantly more frequent in patients with PLSVC than in those without PLSVC (47.4% vs 3.8%; P < .001).
29953955|ab|9|29953955|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In patients with the left AP, the number of RFCA attempts and recurrence were lower in the great cardiac vein group than in the left superior vena cava group.
29953955|ab|10|29953955|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|An SP in the CS is prevalent in patients with AVNRT and PLSVC.
29953955|ab|11|29953955|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|It is useful to place a CS catheter into the great cardiac vein in patients with a left AP and PLSVC.
29847145|ab|1|29847145|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|A lateral patellar dislocation (LPD) is the most common traumatic knee injury with hemarthrosis in children.
29847145|ab|2|29847145|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The redislocation rate is high.
29847145|ab|3|29847145|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Varying operative and nonoperative treatments have been advocated with no consensus on the best treatment.
29847145|ab|4|29847145|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|(1) To evaluate if arthroscopic-assisted repair of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) in patients with an acute first-time traumatic LPD would reduce the recurrence rate and offer better objective/subjective knee function compared with a knee brace without repair.
29847145|ab|5|29847145|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|(2) To study the presence of anatomic patellar instability risk factors (APIFs) and their association with a redislocation.
29847145|ab|6|29847145|STUDY DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
29847145|ab|7|29847145|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This was a prospective series of 74 skeletally immature patients aged 9 to 14 years (38 girls and 36 boys; mean age, 13.1 years) with a first-time traumatic LPD, with clinical examinations, radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and diagnostic arthroscopic surgery performed within 2 weeks of the index injury.
29847145|ab|8|29847145|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The child was randomized to either (1) a knee brace (KB group) for 4 weeks and physical therapy or (2) arthroscopic-assisted repair (R group) of the MPFL with anchors, 4 weeks with a soft cast splint, and physical therapy.
29847145|ab|9|29847145|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The follow-up time was 2 years.
29847145|ab|10|29847145|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The redislocation rate was significantly lower in the R group than in the KB group at final follow-up: 8 patients (22%) versus 16 patients (43%), respectively ( P = .047).
29847145|ab|11|29847145|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for children sport/play and quality of life subscales had lower scores in the R group compared with the KB group; the significant differences were among those with redislocations.
29847145|ab|12|29847145|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean Kujala score was excellent in the KB group (95.9) and good in the R group (90.9).
29847145|ab|13|29847145|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|An impaired Limb Symmetry Index (median, 83%) for concentric quadriceps torque at 90 deg/s was found only in the R group.
29847145|ab|14|29847145|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Eighty-one percent of the study patients had >/=2 APIFs.
29847145|ab|15|29847145|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Trochlear dysplasia (trochlear depth <3 mm) had the highest odds ratio for redislocations (2.35 [95% CI, 0.69-8.03]), with no significant association between APIFs and a redislocation.
29847145|ab|16|29847145|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Operative repair of an MPFL injury in the acute phase in skeletally immature children with a primary traumatic LPD significantly reduced the redislocation rate but did not improve subjective or objective knee function compared with a knee brace without repair.
29847145|ab|17|29847145|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The majority of the patients in both groups were satisfied with their knee function.
29847145|ab|18|29847145|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|There was a high representation of APIFs, which needs to be considered when evaluating the risk of redislocations.

27997286|ab|1|27997286||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Kounis syndrome (KS) is a complex of cardiovascular symptoms and signs following either allergy or hypersensitivity and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid insults.
27997286|ab|2|27997286||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We report the case of 57-year-old man, with hypertension and history of allergy, referred for facial rash and palpitations appeared after consumption of canned tuna fish.
27997286|ab|3|27997286||METHODS|METHODS|Suddenly, the patient collapsed: electrocardiogram showed ST-elevation in inferior leads.
27997286|ab|4|27997286||RESULTS|METHODS|The patient was transferred from the spoke emergency room for coronary angio, which did not show any sign of coronary atherosclerosis.
27997286|ab|5|27997286||METHODS|METHODS|A transient coronary spasm was therefore hypothesized and the final diagnosis was KS.
27997286|ab|6|27997286||RESULTS|RESULTS|To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first cases of KS following the ingestion of tuna fish.
27997286|ab|7|27997286||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|KS secondary to food allergy has also been reported, and shellfish ingestion has been considered as one of the most active KS inducer foods.
27997286|ab|8|27997286||CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|Canned tuna fish too is well known as an allergy inducer.
27997286|ab|9|27997286||RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|Tuna fish allergy should be considered, however, within the context of scombroid food poisoning, also called histamine fish poisoning.
27997286|ab|10|27997286||CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|Fish with high levels of free histidine, the enzyme substrate converted to histamine by bacterial histidine decarboxylase, are those most often implicated in scombroid poisoning.
27997286|ab|11|27997286||CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|Inflammatory mediators such as histamine constitute the pathophysiologic basis of Kounis hypersensitivity-associated acute coronary syndrome.
27997286|ab|12|27997286||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Patients with coronary risk factors, allergic reaction after food ingestion, and suspected scombroid poisoning should be therefore carefully monitored for a prompt diagnosis of possible coronary complications.
27343861|ab|1|27343861||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Pinna and Sirigu (2011) demonstrated a new principle of grouping, called the accentuation principle, stating that, all else being equal, elements tend to group in the same oriented direction of the discontinuous element placed within a whole set of continuous/homogeneous components.
27343861|ab|2|27343861||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The discontinuous element behaves like an accent, i.e. a visual emphasis within the wholeness of components as shown in the next section.
27343861|ab|3|27343861||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|In this work, the accentuation principle has been extended to new visual domains.
27343861|ab|4|27343861||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|In particular, it is shown how this principle affects shape perception.
27343861|ab|5|27343861||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Moreover several visual object attributes are also highlighted, among which orientation, spatial position, inner dynamics and apparent motion that determine the so-called organic segmentation and furthermore tend to induce figure-ground segregation.
27343861|ab|6|27343861||RESULTS|RESULTS|On the basis of the results of experimental phenomenology, the accentuation can be considered as a complex principle ruling grouping, figure-ground segregation, shape and meaning formation.
27343861|ab|7|27343861||RESULTS|RESULTS|Through a new musical illusion of downbeat, it is also demonstrated that this principle influences perceptual organization not only in space but also in time and, thus, in both visual and musical domains.
27343861|ab|8|27343861||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|This illusion can be heard in eight measures of Pagodes, a solo piano music by Claude Debussy (1862-1918), where a strong physical-perceptual discrepancy in terms of upbeats and downbeats inversion is strongly perceived in both staves.
29953309|ab|1|29953309|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To examine the spectrum of scleritis in four tertiary institutions across the Asia-Pacific.
29953309|ab|2|29953309|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Clinical records from 354 patients were reviewed from centers in Australia, Singapore, and India, excluding those with insufficient data (n = 24).
29953309|ab|3|29953309|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Indian patients presented younger (41.5 +/- 13.4 years) than Australians (50.8 +/- 17.5) and Singaporeans (48.6 +/- 15.9), with fewer women (49% vs 62%/57%).
29953309|ab|4|29953309|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Diffuse disease was universally most common.
29953309|ab|5|29953309|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Autoimmune and infectious disease proportions were similar in Australia (31%/10.3%) and Singapore (27.5%/8.3%) but reversed in India (8.3%/30%).
29953309|ab|6|29953309|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Necrotizing scleritis was most frequently associated with infection (27.3%).
29953309|ab|7|29953309|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Presumed ocular tuberculosis accounted for 75% of infectious cases in India.
29953309|ab|8|29953309|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Posterior scleritis had the highest complication rate (82.4%) and immunosuppressants used per patient (0.98 +/- 0.31 95% CI).
29953309|ab|9|29953309|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Clinical presentations of scleritis vary across the Asia-Pacific, particularly in endemic regions for tuberculosis such as India, where it affects younger men with a predominance of nodular and infectious disease.
29798794|ab|1|29798794|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study determined whether obesity increased the risk of failed shocks and complications among subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) recipients.
29798794|ab|2|29798794|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The S-ICD is an established treatment for patients at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias.
29798794|ab|3|29798794|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Obesity may increase the transvenous defibrillation threshold and the rate of complications.
29798794|ab|4|29798794|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We analyzed data from the 321 patients enrolled in the S-ICD Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study.
29798794|ab|5|29798794|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|They were categorized into 3 body mass index (BMI) groups: <25 kg/m(2) (underweight and normal), 25 to 30 kg/m(2) (overweight), and >30 kg/m(2) (obese).
29798794|ab|6|29798794|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patients underwent implantation followed by defibrillation testing at 65 J.
29798794|ab|7|29798794|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Chronic defibrillation testing was repeated >150 days post implantation in a subset of patients.
29798794|ab|8|29798794|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Seventy-nine patients had BMI <25 kg/m(2), 105 had BMI 25 to 30 kg/m(2), and 137 had BMI >30 kg/m(2).
29798794|ab|9|29798794|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A failed first shock of any kind occurred in 52 patients, including 41 patients during implant defibrillation testing, 11 patients during chronic defibrillation testing, and 5 patients during spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias.
29798794|ab|10|29798794|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The rate of failed first shocks during implant defibrillation testing increased across BMI categories (5.1% among underweight and normal patients, 13.3% among overweight patients, and 16.9% among obese patients; p = 0.04).
29798794|ab|11|29798794|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Among obese patients, shock impedance was higher during failed first shocks than successful first shocks (103.5 ohms vs. 84.6 ohms; p = 0.001).
29798794|ab|12|29798794|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The rate of failed first shocks during chronic defibrillation testing and spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias did not significantly differ among BMI groups, nor did the rate of complications.
29798794|ab|13|29798794|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Of the 8 underweight patients, there were no failed shocks or complications.
29798794|ab|14|29798794|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Obese patients are at increased risk of failed first S-ICD shocks during defibrillation testing.
29798794|ab|15|29798794|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Whether this can be overcome by optimal implantation techniques remains unknown.
29798794|ab|16|29798794|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Rates of complications were not increased among obese patients.
27459323|ab|1|27459323||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique combined with three-step reduction in the treatment of thoracolumbar fracture.
27459323|ab|2|27459323||METHODS|METHODS|Methods This is a retrospective study, based on medical records from the archives of the Fifth People's Hospital of Fudan University, from January 2012 to January 2015.
27459323|ab|3|27459323||METHODS|METHODS|The 49 patients with thoracolumbar fracture were treated with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique combined with three-step reduction.
27459323|ab|4|27459323||METHODS|METHODS|The treatment plan was determined by the AO classification and the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity classification.
27459323|ab|5|27459323||METHODS|METHODS|Baseline data included patient demographics, mechanism of injuries, fracture level, and neurologic status.
27459323|ab|6|27459323||METHODS|METHODS|Kyphotic angle correction and vertebral body height (VBH) restoration were used to assess radiologic outcome.
27459323|ab|7|27459323||METHODS|METHODS|Blood loss, operative complications, hospital stay, and pain score on the visual analog scale (VAS) were used to assess safety and clinical outcomes.
27459323|ab|8|27459323||RESULTS|RESULTS|Result A total of 49 patients with 51 thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique combined with three-step reduction.
27459323|ab|9|27459323||RESULTS|RESULTS|There was significant improvement in kyphotic angle correction (p < 0.05) and restoration of anterior vertebral height (p < 0.05) after each reduction procedure.
27459323|ab|10|27459323||RESULTS|RESULTS|These improvements remained statistically significant at the latest follow-up for restoration of anterior VBH (p < 0.05) and kyphotic angle correction (p < 0.05).
27459323|ab|11|27459323||RESULTS|RESULTS|The preoperative VAS score was 8.2 +/- 1.3, and the postoperative VAS score (3 days after the operation) was 3.5 +/- 0.7.
27459323|ab|12|27459323||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Conclusion Percutaneous pedicle screw internal fixation technique combined with three-step reduction is a relatively safe and effective technique for treating selected thoracolumbar burst fractures, and it yields satisfactory results.
29788024|ab|1|29788024|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a second-line therapy for steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD).
29788024|ab|2|29788024|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We describe the long-term efficacy and tolerability of ECP according to the cutaneous phenotype of cGVHD and report on the reduced need for immunosuppressant drugs in this setting.
29788024|ab|3|29788024|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Fourteen patients (8 females) with cutaneous and/or mucosal cGVHD, treated with ECP between October 2010 and May 2016 within a single center, were included.
29788024|ab|4|29788024|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Final analyses included patients who had received ECP for at least 12 months.
29788024|ab|5|29788024|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of ECP using lesion-specific clinical scores and by recording changed doses of systemic immunosuppressants.
29788024|ab|6|29788024|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Of the 14 patients, sclerotic skin lesions were present in 10 (71%).
29788024|ab|7|29788024|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mRODNAN score decreased in all patients from month 9 onwards, with 40 and 77% reductions at 12 and 36 months, respectively.
29788024|ab|8|29788024|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Six patients (43%) presented with cutaneous lichenoid lesions: this score was reduced in all patients by month 3, reaching a 93% reduction by month 12.
29788024|ab|9|29788024|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Five patients (36%) experienced oral mucosal lichenoid lesions: these scores were decreased by 55% at month 12 and by 100% by month 33.
29788024|ab|10|29788024|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The use of systemic immunosuppressants was reduced in all patients; 4 patients could stop all immunosuppressant drugs after 2 years.
29788024|ab|11|29788024|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|ECP was stopped in 3 patients after a complete response.
29788024|ab|12|29788024|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|No major ECP-associated adverse effects were observed.
29788024|ab|13|29788024|DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|ECP was an effective long-term therapy for oral and cutaneous cGVHD: consequently, dose levels of therapeutic immunosuppression could be reduced.
28221365|ab|1|28221365||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Ketamine and deep brain stimulation produce rapid antidepressant effects in humans and rodents.
28221365|ab|2|28221365||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|An increased AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) signaling in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been suggested to mediate these responses.
28221365|ab|3|28221365||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, little research has addressed the direct effects of enhancing glutamate tone or AMPA-R stimulation in mPFC subdivisions.
28221365|ab|4|28221365||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The current study investigates the behavioral and neurochemical consequences of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) blockade or s-AMPA microinfusion in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PrL) cortex.
28221365|ab|5|28221365||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Owing to the connectivity between the mPFC and raphe nuclei, the role of serotonin is also explored.
28221365|ab|6|28221365||RESULTS|RESULTS|The bilateral microinfusion of the depolarizing agent veratridine into IL -but not PrL- of rats evoked immediate antidepressant-like responses.
28221365|ab|7|28221365||RESULTS|RESULTS|The same regional selectivity was observed after microinfusion of dihydrokainic acid (DHK), a selective inhibitor of GLT-1, present in astrocytes.
28221365|ab|8|28221365||RESULTS|RESULTS|The DHK-evoked antidepressant-like responses appear to be mediated by an AMPA-R-driven enhancement of serotonergic activity, as (i) they were prevented by NBQX 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium salt) and mimicked by s-AMPA; (ii) DHK and s-AMPA elevated similarly extracellular glutamate in IL and PrL, although extracellular 5-HT and c-fos expression in the midbrain dorsal raphe increased only when these agents were applied in IL; and (iii) DHK antidepressant-like responses were prevented by 5-HT synthesis inhibition and mimicked by citalopram microinfusion in IL.
28221365|ab|9|28221365||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These results indicate that an acute increase of glutamatergic neurotransmission selectively in IL triggers immediate antidepressant-like responses in rats, likely mediated by the activation of IL-raphe pathways, which then results in a fast increase of serotonergic activity.
29952274|ab|1|29952274|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Occupational asthma occurs in a significant number of adult unset forms of asthma.
29952274|ab|2|29952274|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Even after exposure cessation, persistent asthma is frequent.
29952274|ab|3|29952274|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although recognized as important, nutrition, and specifically vitamin D intake, was rarely evaluated in occupational asthma.
29952274|ab|4|29952274|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To assess the vitamin D intake in occupational asthma patients and the relation with body mass index, co-morbidities related to vitamin D deficit, lung function and quality of life.
29952274|ab|5|29952274|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We found a reduced vitamin D intake in both irritant and allergic asthma, in obese and non-obese patients.
29952274|ab|6|29952274|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The average intake in non-obese patients, although higher, did not reach statistical significance.
29952274|ab|7|29952274|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We also found lower vitamin D intake in the mild ashma group versus the severe group, marginally reaching the significance level (p=0.056) at the median test.
29952274|ab|8|29952274|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Regression analysis in asthma subpopulations revealed a different pattern of correlation, with stronger relationship between the BMI and the impact score in irritant asthma and a closer link between vitamin D intake and symptoms score (p= 0.027) in the allergic asthma group.
29952274|ab|9|29952274|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The relation between obesity and vitamin D on clinical scores and lung function seams to be different according to the asthma phenotype.
29952274|ab|10|29952274|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|However, our study supports the usefulness of nutritional interventions in all occupational asthma patients, targeting both the reduction of the fat mass and the achievement of the recommended daily intake of vitamin D.
29952274|ab|11|29952274|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|When analyzing the impact of the weight loss effect on asthma evolution, the vitamin D status should be also considered as influencer.
27142964|ab|1|27142964||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We aim to establish an in vivo animal model of acute inflammation using PAF (platelet activating factor) as inflammatory agent and to study the erythrocyte deformability changes induced by the inflammatory response.
27142964|ab|2|27142964||METHODS|METHODS|Counting the number of rolling and adherent neutrophils to endothelium after 2, 4 and 6h of intrascrotal injection of PAF we showed the induction of an inflammatory state.
27142964|ab|3|27142964||METHODS|METHODS|Blood samples are collected in order to measure the erythrocyte deformability and to quantify NO efflux from the red blood cells (RBCs).
27142964|ab|4|27142964||RESULTS|RESULTS|The results show an increased number of rolling and adherent neutrophils after 2h and 4h of inflammation as well as decreased values of erythrocyte deformability in the same time-points.
27142964|ab|5|27142964||RESULTS|RESULTS|This result is in line with the need of a low blood viscosity to the recruitment process that will improve leukocyte migration towards the endothelial wall.
27142964|ab|6|27142964||RESULTS|RESULTS|NO efflux from RBCs is also affected by the inflammatory response at the first hours of inflammation.
27142964|ab|7|27142964||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This animal model demonstrates in vivo the association between an acute inflammatory response and the rheological properties of the blood, namely the RBCs deformability.
27142964|ab|8|27142964||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|For those reasons we consider this as an adequate model to study acute inflammatory responses as well as hemorheological parameters.

29779724|ab|2|29779724|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Access to social media in low- and middle-income countries has increased exponentially in recent years due to technological advances.
29779724|ab|3|29779724|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Despite this growth, the use of social media in low- and middle-income countries is less well-researched than in high-income countries.
29779724|ab|4|29779724|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To identify, explore and summarize the current state of the literature on the use of social media for health in low- and middle-income countries.
29779724|ab|5|29779724|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A scoping review was conducted on literature available to December 2017.
29779724|ab|6|29779724|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Six databases were searched, and grey literature was identified through the Google and Google Scholar search engines.
29779724|ab|7|29779724|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Literature was considered for inclusion if it (1) was published in English, (2) was conducted in or in relation to a low or middle-income country, (3) reported on as least one type of social media or social media use generally for health purposes, and (4) reported on at least one aspect of human health.
29779724|ab|8|29779724|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Content analysis was performed to identify themes.
29779724|ab|9|29779724|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Forty articles met the inclusion criteria.
29779724|ab|10|29779724|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Thirty-one were research articles, and nine were review/discussion/descriptive and evaluative reports.
29779724|ab|11|29779724|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Since 2010, when the first article was published, most of the literature has focused on Asian (n=15) and African (n=12) countries.
29779724|ab|12|29779724|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Twitter (n=11) and Facebook (n=10) were the most frequently discussed individual social media platforms.
29779724|ab|13|29779724|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Four themes were identified: (1) use for health education and influence (sub-themes were health behaviour and health education); (2) use within infectious disease and outbreak situations; (3) use within natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response situations; and (4) producers and consumers of social media for health (sub-themes were misinformation, organizational challenges, users' expectations, and challenges of unique sub-populations).

29781157|ab|1|29781157|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Since 2010, the Ethiopian government introduced different measures to implement community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes to improve access to health service and reduce the catastrophic effect of health care costs.
29781157|ab|2|29781157|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to examine the determinants of enrollment in CBHI in Northwest Ethiopia.
29781157|ab|3|29781157|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In this study, we utilized a mix of quantitative (multivariate logistic regression applied to population survey linked with health facility survey) and qualitative (focus group discussion and in-depth interview) methods to better understand the factors that affect CBHI enrollment.
29781157|ab|4|29781157|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The study revealed important factors, such as household, informal association, and health facility, as barriers to CBHI enrollment.
29781157|ab|5|29781157|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Age and educational status, self-rated health status, perceived quality of health services, knowledge, and information (awareness) about CBHI were among the characteristics of individual household head, affecting enrollment.
29781157|ab|6|29781157|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Household size and participation in an informal association, such as local credit associations, were also positively associated with CBHI enrollment.
29781157|ab|7|29781157|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Additionally, health facility factors like unavailability of laboratory tests were the main factor that hinders CBHI enrollment.
29781157|ab|8|29781157|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This study showed a possibility of adverse selection in CBHI enrollment.
29781157|ab|9|29781157|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Additionally, perceived quality of health services, knowledge, and information (awareness) are positively associated with CBHI enrollment.
29781157|ab|10|29781157|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Therefore, policy interventions to mitigate adverse selection as well as provision of social marketing activities are crucial to increase enrollment in CBHI.
29781157|ab|11|29781157|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Furthermore, policy interventions that enhance the capacity of health facilities and schemes to provide the promised services are necessary.
29798790|ab|1|29798790|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study sought to compare the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation (CA) with those of medical therapy (MT) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF).
29798790|ab|2|29798790|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The preferred therapeutic strategy for subjects with AF remains unclear.
29798790|ab|3|29798790|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 17 randomized controlled trials were selected using Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (September 1998 to 2 February 2018).
29798790|ab|4|29798790|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The analysis was stratified at the trial level according to the following: 1) patients with AF and heart failure (HF); and 2) patients with AF without HF.
29798790|ab|5|29798790|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A total of 2,272 patients with AF (775 patients with HF and 1,497 patients without HF) participated in this analysis.
29798790|ab|6|29798790|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In patients with HF, CA was associated with significant relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR]: 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36 to 0.76; p < 0.001; I(2) = 0), recurrent atrial arrhythmia (RR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.61; p <0.001; I(2) = 56), and cardiac hospitalization (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.87; p = 0.01; I(2) = 43) compared with MT.
29798790|ab|7|29798790|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Conversely, in patients without HF, CA had no beneficial effect on the risk of all-cause mortality compared with MT (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.29 to 2.61; p = 0.81; I(2) = 0).
29798790|ab|8|29798790|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, CA reduced the risk of recurrent atrial arrhythmia (RR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.52; p < 0.001; I(2) = 73) and cardiac hospitalization (RR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.45; p < 0.001; I(2) = 0) in patients without HF.
29798790|ab|9|29798790|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This meta-analysis suggests that although CA reduced the risk of cardiac hospitalization and recurrent atrial arrhythmia both in subjects with HF and in subjects without HF, the reduction in all-cause mortality was limited to subjects with HF only.
29773466|ab|1|29773466|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study aimed to assess the pathophysiological differences between saphenous vein grafts (SVG) and native coronary arteries (NCA) following presentation with non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
29773466|ab|2|29773466|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|There is accelerated pathogenesis of de novo coronary disease in harvested SVG following coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery, which contributes to both early and late graft failure, and is also causal in adverse outcomes following vein graft PCI.
29773466|ab|3|29773466|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However in vivo assessment, with OCT imaging, comparing the differences between vein grafts and NCAs has not previously been performed.
29773466|ab|4|29773466|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We performed a retrospective, observational, analysis in patients who underwent PCI with adjunctive OCT imaging following presentation with NSTEMI, where the infarct-related artery (IRA) was either in an SVG or NCA.
29773466|ab|5|29773466|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A total of 1550 OCT segments was analysed from thirty patients with a mean age of 66.3 (+/-9.0) years were included.
29773466|ab|6|29773466|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean graft age of 13.9 (+/-5.6) years in the SVG group.
29773466|ab|7|29773466|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|OCT imaging showed that the SVG group had evidence of increased lipid pool burden (lipid pool quadrants, 2.1 vs 2.7; p=0.021), with a reduced fibro-atheroma cap-thickness in the SVG group (45.0mum vs 38.5mum; p=0.05) and increased burden of calcification (calcified lesion length=0.4mm vs 1.8mm; p=0.007; calcified quadrants=0.2 vs 0.9; p=0.001; arc of superficial calcium deposits=11.6 degrees vs 50.9 degrees ; p=0.007) when compared to NCA.
29773466|ab|8|29773466|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This OCT study has demonstrated that vein grafts have a uniquely atherogenic environment which leads to the development of calcified, lipogenic, thin-capped fibro-atheroma's, which may be pivotal in the increased, acute and chronic graft failure rate, and may underpin the increased adverse outcomes following vein graft PCI.
29954859|ab|1|29954859|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|At its sixth meeting (Moscow, November 2014), the Conference of the Parties (COP) adopted decision FCTC/COP6(13) that called for an impact assessment to 'examine the impact of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) on the implementation of tobacco control measures and on the effectiveness of its implementation' after its first 10 years.
29954859|ab|2|29954859|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|An independent expert group (EG) was established to conduct the impact assessment, and report their findings at COP7 (Delhi, November 2016).
29954859|ab|3|29954859|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|This article describes the methodology used by the EG to conduct the first comprehensive multi-method assessment of the possible causal impact of the FCTC on global tobacco control over the past decade.
29954859|ab|4|29954859|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The EG developed and followed a four-stage process model to conduct the impact assessment: (1) desk review of literature on FCTC impact; (2) collection and analysis of interview data from 12 country missions; (3) data synthesis and interpretation; and (4) preparation of a final report.
29954859|ab|5|29954859|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The EG developed and engaged in a transparent and systematic process to conduct the FCTC impact assessment.
29954859|ab|6|29954859|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The methods employed were rigorous, and explicitly guided by concerns about the difficulty of ascribing cause-and-effect relations.
29954859|ab|7|29954859|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The EG's report and supporting documents represent important sources of the positive impact of the Convention over its first decade.
29954859|ab|8|29954859|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|As development of the FCTC increasingly shifts to mechanisms for accelerating global implementation, the EG's process model can be used as a methodology to assist Parties in carrying out their own assessments of the impact of the Treaty.
29956006|ab|1|29956006|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Ferric citrate, an iron-based phosphate binder, has been shown to improve both hyperphosphatemia and iron deficiency in adult chronic kidney disease patients, but its use in the pediatric dialysis population has not been described.
29956006|ab|2|29956006|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This is a retrospective analysis of 11 unselected pediatric dialysis patients who received ferric citrate as a phosphate binder between 2015 and 2017.
29956006|ab|3|29956006|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Time-averaged laboratory values were compared pre- and post-ferric citrate initiation using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
29956006|ab|4|29956006|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The median age of this cohort was 13 years old (range 4-17 years old).
29956006|ab|5|29956006|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Five patients were on hemodialysis, and six patients were on peritoneal dialysis.
29956006|ab|6|29956006|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The median duration of ferric citrate therapy was 214 days (range 39-654 days), with a median time-averaged ferric citrate dose of 3.5 tablets per day (range 1.5-8.4 tablets per day).
29956006|ab|7|29956006|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared to the pre-ferric citrate period, ferric citrate treatment was associated with decreased serum phosphate (6.5 to 5.2 mg/dl, p = 0.014), decreased phosphate age-related standard deviation score (SDS) (2.3 to 0.9, p = 0.019), increased transferrin saturation (26 to 34%, p = 0.049), increased ferritin (107 to 230 ng/ml, p = 0.074), and maintenance of hematocrit.
29956006|ab|8|29956006|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In pediatric dialysis patients, ferric citrate may be able to concurrently lower phosphate levels and treat iron deficiency.
29956006|ab|9|29956006|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|However, larger studies are needed to further evaluate safety and efficacy in the pediatric chronic kidney disease population.
29958124|ab|1|29958124|STUDY OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We tested the hypothesis that over many years - a decade - hospitals' proportions of surgical cases that were performed on weekends and holidays remained stable.
29958124|ab|2|29958124|DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|Retrospective cohort study.
29958124|ab|3|29958124|SETTING|METHODS|METHODS|Iowa Hospital Association data were from January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2017.
29958124|ab|4|29958124|SETTING|METHODS|METHODS|The N=42 hospitals included were those with at least 10 cases performed during holidays or weekends for each of the periods.
29958124|ab|5|29958124|MEASUREMENTS|METHODS|METHODS|The number of surgical cases performed at each hospital during each of the 21half-year periods was considered the count of unique combinations of hospital, patient, and date with at least one major therapeutic procedure.
29958124|ab|6|29958124|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|METHODS|Absolute predictive errors in cases per weekend or holiday day were calculated using a proportional model and using a quadratic model for each hospital and half-year period.
29958124|ab|7|29958124|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Pooling among hospitals, the sample mean absolute predictive errors were greater for the proportional model than for the quadratic model (P<0.0001).
29958124|ab|8|29958124|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, the mean difference was just 0.0027 cases per weekend or holiday day (SE 0.0001), significantly less than even 1 case per day (P<0.0001).
29958124|ab|9|29958124|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The sample means of the pairwise differences in predictive errors were smaller than 1 case per day for all 42 hospitals, significantly so for 41 of the 42 hospitals (P</=0.005).
29958124|ab|10|29958124|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|These conditions applied to all other hospitals in the state, because each performed few cases on weekends and holidays.
29958124|ab|11|29958124|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|For the anesthesia group caring for patients at a hospital over several years, weekend and holiday anesthesia caseload should be expected to increase approximately proportionately to changes during regular workdays.
29958124|ab|12|29958124|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Average weekend workload can be benchmarked using hospitals' percentages of operating room cases performed on weekends and holidays.
29956396|ab|1|29956396|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Accurate and efficient measurement of patient-reported outcomes is key in cancer symptom management trials.
29956396|ab|2|29956396|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|The newer Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and previously developed measures of similar conceptual content (legacy) are available to measure symptoms and functioning.
29956396|ab|3|29956396|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This report compares the performance of two sets of measures, PROMIS and legacy, in a recently completed trial of a supportive care intervention that enrolled breast cancer patients and their friend or family caregivers.
29956396|ab|4|29956396|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patient-caregiver dyads (N = 256) were randomized to either reflexology delivered by caregivers or usual care control.
29956396|ab|5|29956396|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Post-intervention, PROMIS and legacy measures of symptoms and functioning were analyzed in relation to trial arm, while adjusting for baseline values.
29956396|ab|6|29956396|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Responsiveness of the two sets of measures was assessed using effect sizes and P-values for the effect of trial arm on patients' and caregivers' symptom and functioning outcomes.
29956396|ab|7|29956396|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Similar conclusions about intervention effects were found using PROMIS and legacy measures for pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, physical, and social functioning.
29956396|ab|8|29956396|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Different conclusions were obtained for patient and caregiver depression: legacy measures indicated the efficacy of reflexology, while PROMIS depression measure did not.
29956396|ab|9|29956396|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Evidence of similar responsiveness supports the use of either set of measures for symptoms and functioning in clinical and general populations.
29956396|ab|10|29956396|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Differences between PROMIS and legacy measures of depression need to be considered when choosing instruments for use in trials of supportive care interventions and in clinical practice.
29953496|ab|1|29953496|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|High levels of sedentary behaviours have been independently associated with several negative health indicators, including obesity.
29953496|ab|2|29953496|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Screen time (ST) is often used as a contributing measure of sedentary time.
29953496|ab|3|29953496|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is recommended that children spend no more than 2 hours on recreational sedentary screen-based activities daily.
29953496|ab|4|29953496|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We describe screen-based sedentary time of urban school children and examine the associations between body mass index (BMI) and percent Body Fat (%BF) with ST levels.
29953496|ab|5|29953496|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Data were collected from 563 children aged 9 to 11 years attending 29 non-boarding primary schools in Nairobi, Kenya, as part of the International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and the Environment (ISCOLE).
29953496|ab|6|29953496|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Data were analysed to test for associations between ST and sex, type of school attended (public verses private), Socioeconomic status, adiposity, and access to electronic devices.
29953496|ab|7|29953496|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We also assessed participants' ST on school and weekend days.
29953496|ab|8|29953496|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Of the participants recruited, 15.5% had high ST levels, 67.9% spent no more than 2 hours in recreational screen activities on school days while 74.2% did not meet the guidelines on weekend days.
29953496|ab|9|29953496|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Participants sex was associated with daily ST (t = 3.5, p<0.001), ST on the weekend (t = 3.9, p <0.001) and total ST per week (t = 3.5, p<0.001) with males having higher ST than females.
29953496|ab|10|29953496|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|ST was associated with type of school for daily ST (t = 3.6, p <0.001), ST on the weekend (t = 4.5, p<0.001) and total ST per week (t = 3.6, p<0.001) where private schools pupils had higher ST.
29953496|ab|11|29953496|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|ST was not associated with BMI.
29953496|ab|12|29953496|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|ST was not associated with %BF except on weekend days (p = 0.038) where those classified as overfat/obese (fat) had higher ST.
29953496|ab|13|29953496|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|A large proportion of children spend more time than recommended on screen activities particularly on weekend days.
29953496|ab|14|29953496|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Strategies to improve healthy living should focus on the reduction of sedentary ST for school-aged children.
29956093|ab|1|29956093|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) historically involves a separate appointment in the Radiology Department to undergo injection of the radiocolloid tracer (RT) the day of, or prior to, surgery, which can lead to disruptions in scheduling.
29956093|ab|2|29956093|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Furthermore, the patient must endure an additional procedure.
29956093|ab|3|29956093|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In a pilot study, intraoperative injection of the RT was previously shown to be equally as effective as preoperative injection.
29956093|ab|4|29956093|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|This study evaluates the efficacy of this method in a large cohort and examines factors associated with failure of the RT to reach the axilla.
29956093|ab|5|29956093|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A retrospective review of patients who underwent SLNB between June 2010 and June 2017 was performed.
29956093|ab|6|29956093|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|All patients were injected immediately following intubation with sulfur colloid and blue dye, unless contraindicated.
29956093|ab|7|29956093|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Operative records were reviewed to determine whether sentinel nodes were identified and if gamma counts were detected.
29956093|ab|8|29956093|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patient and tumor characteristics were examined to identify factors related to failed RT uptake in the axilla.
29956093|ab|9|29956093|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In 7 years, 453 SLNBs were performed, with sentinel nodes being detected in 447 (98.7%) of these SLNBs.
29956093|ab|10|29956093|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In the six cases where no nodes were detected, all had a prior ipsilateral axillary procedure.
29956093|ab|11|29956093|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Sentinel nodes were undetectable with the gamma probe in 16 (3.5%) cases; a prior axillary procedure was the only statistically significant independent variable associated with this failure.
29956093|ab|12|29956093|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Intraoperative injection of the RT is highly effective in the detection of sentinel nodes in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients.
29956093|ab|13|29956093|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Eliminating the need for a preoperative injection of RT can avoid scheduling conflicts and decrease patient morbidity.
29956823|ab|1|29956823|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The rs738409 C>G p.I148M variant in the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3)-gene promotes triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cell activation and has previously been linked to hepatic steatosis/liver fibrosis.
29956823|ab|2|29956823|AIM|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To investigate its impact on hepatic decompensation and (liver-related) mortality in patients who had already developed portal hypertension.
29956823|ab|3|29956823|AIM|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Moreover, we assessed its link with hepatic steatosis as evaluated by controlled attenuation parameter.
29956823|ab|4|29956823|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We performed a retrospective analysis in prospectively characterised patients with viral hepatitis/fatty liver disease-induced portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] >/= 6 mm Hg) diagnosed at the Medical University of Vienna who underwent HVPG measurement (until 2013; n = 372; longitudinal study) or simultaneous HVPG and controlled attenuation parameter measurement (2014-2017; n = 153; cross-sectional study).
29956823|ab|5|29956823|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|While survival was similar between PNPLA3-C/C and -C/G patients, we observed substantially increased mortality in PNPLA3-G/G patients.
29956823|ab|6|29956823|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|PNPLA3-G/G had no impact on mortality in the subgroup of patients with viral hepatitis; however, we observed a strong independent association between PNPLA3-G/G and hepatic decompensation (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR]: 2.1, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.1-4; P = 0.024) as well as mortality (overall: aSHR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.22-3.98; P = 0.009; liver-related: aSHR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.08-4.46; P = 0.029) in patients with fatty liver disease.
29956823|ab|7|29956823|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Interestingly, even in the subgroup of patients who had already progressed to clinically significant portal hypertension (HVPG >/= 10 mm Hg), PNPLA3-G/G substantially increased mortality (aSHR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.27-4.29; P = 0.006).
29956823|ab|8|29956823|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|PNPLA3-genotype had no influence on controlled attenuation parameter or the prevalence of values >/=248 dB/m.
29956823|ab|9|29956823|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|PNPLA3-G/G-genotype seems to double the risks of hepatic decompensation and (liver-related) mortality in patients with portal hypertension due to fatty liver disease.
29956823|ab|10|29956823|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Further studies are warranted to investigate potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms unrelated to hepatic steatosis.

29779806|ab|2|29779806|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The biofortification aims to reach the root of the problem of malnutrition, targets the neediest population, uses embedded distribution mechanisms, is scientifically feasible and effective in terms of cost, and complements other ongoing interventions to control micronutrient deficiency.
29779806|ab|3|29779806|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, to ensure effectiveness, measurement of the absorption of minerals is essential.
29779806|ab|4|29779806|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The objective of this study was to evaluate the iron bioavailability of common bean BRS Pontal (PO), targeted for biofortification, compared with common bean BRS Estilo in man through reliable techniques that have not been previously used in Brazil.
29779806|ab|5|29779806|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The study included 29 young adult volunteers divided into 2 groups: Group CB (13 subjects) received 100 g of common beans (BRS-Estilo) cooked labeled with iron-58 ((58)Fe) and Group TBB (16 patients) received 100 g common bean target for iron biofortification (BRS-Pontal), cooked and labeled with iron58 ((58)Fe).

29779806|ab|7|29779806|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Isotopic evaluation of iron for measurement of iron incorporation into erythrocytes was performed 14 days after consumption.
29779806|ab|8|29779806|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The beans used, were produced, through conventional breeding program, by EMBRAPA/Rice and Beans.
29779806|ab|9|29779806|RESULTS|RESULTS|METHODS|The iron absorption was evaluated by assessing the isotopic enrichment of the stable isotope.
29779806|ab|10|29779806|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean iron absorption from the meal with common beans was 0.409% (+/-0.040%) and mean iron incorporation from the meal with target beans for biofortification 0.407% (+/-0.038%) and did not differ between the groups.
29779806|ab|11|29779806|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This study tested the iron absorption from a single bean meal in healthy volunteers or non anemics, In the present study the iron absorption ratio from common bean Pontal (PO), targeted for biofortification and compared with common bean BRS Estilo was not significantly different.
29779806|ab|12|29779806|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The iron concentration of the TBB, probably was not sufficient to improve higher bioavailability.
29779806|ab|13|29779806|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|It is recommended to evaluate the not only the absorption of iron in cultivars that present a higher difference in iron concentration but also in association with other components of the Brazilian diet, such as rice and beans.

29796578|ab|3|29796578|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To evaluate the performance of a commercial and an in-house qPCR test for quantitative detection of BK virus in kidney transplant recipients.
29796578|ab|4|29796578|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This was a prospective study with kidney transplant recipients from two large university hospitals in Brazil.
29796578|ab|5|29796578|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patients were screened for BKV infection every 3 months in the first year post-transplant with a commercial and an in-house real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test.

27782120|ab|1|27782120||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Since transgenic crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins were first released, resistance evolution leading to failure in control of pests populations has been observed in a number of species.
27782120|ab|2|27782120||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Field resistance of the moth Busseola fusca was acknowledged 8 years after Bt maize was introduced in South Africa.
27782120|ab|3|27782120||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Since then, field resistance of this corn borer has been observed at several locations, raising questions about the nature, distribution and dynamics of the resistance trait.
27782120|ab|4|27782120||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|Using genetic markers, our study identified four outlier loci clearly associated with resistance.
27782120|ab|5|27782120||METHODS|RESULTS|In addition, genetic structure at neutral loci reflected extensive gene flow among populations.
27782120|ab|6|27782120||RESULTS|RESULTS|A realistically parameterised model suggests that resistance could travel in space at speed of several kilometres a year.
27782120|ab|7|27782120||RESULTS|RESULTS|Markers at outlier loci delineated a geographic region associated with resistance spread.
27782120|ab|8|27782120||RESULTS|RESULTS|This was an area of approximately 100 km radius, including the location where resistance was first reported.
27782120|ab|9|27782120||RESULTS|RESULTS|Controlled crosses corroborated these findings and showed significant differences of progeny survival on Bt plants depending on the origin of the resistant parent.

29783019|ab|3|29783019|AIM OF THE STUDY|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study investigated the possibility of increasing peak bone mass in young rats using the total flavonoid extract of Epimedium herb (TFE).
29783019|ab|4|29783019|MATERIALS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|TFE was intragastrically administered to one-month-old Wistar rats at a low (100mg/kg), middle (200mg/kg) or high dose (400mg/kg).
29783019|ab|5|29783019|MATERIALS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Whole body bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry every two weeks.
29783019|ab|6|29783019|MATERIALS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|When BMD of any one of TFE groups was found to be significantly higher than that of the control, all rats were sacrificed, serum samples were collected for bone turnover biochemical assays, and femurs, tibiae and vertebrae were isolated and used in BMD, mechanical, micro-structural, histomorphometric and mechanistic studies.
29783019|ab|7|29783019|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Administration of TFE at middle and high doses for two months significantly increased the whole body, femoral and vertebral BMDs, and improved the bone mechanical and micro-architectural properties.
29783019|ab|8|29783019|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The serum turnover biochemical results and the enhanced expression levels of bone-formation regulatory genes (Runx-2, OSX, and BMP-2) demonstrated that TFE administration increased bone formation but had no effect on bone resorption.
29783019|ab|9|29783019|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The increased phosphorylation levels in femurs of PKA and CREB and expression of AC10 (the only soluble form of adenylyl cyclase) and the increased serum cAMP level after 4h of TFE administration indicated that TFE promoted bone formation by activating the AC10/cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway in vivo.

29788764|ab|6|29788764|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The project resulted in (1) booklet designed to increase knowledge of risk, (2) meme generator that mirrors the booklet graphics and allows youth to create their own meme based on their pancreas' current mood, (3) environmental posters for clinic, and (4) brief self-assessment that acts as a conversation starter for the health educators.
29788764|ab|7|29788764|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Patients reported high likability and satisfaction with the health education tools, with the majority of patients giving the materials an "A" rating.

29953979|ab|1|29953979|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to investigate the association of gait speed and gait variability, an index of how much gait parameters, such as step time, fluctuate step-to-step, with risk of cognitive decline in cognitively normal elderly individuals.
29953979|ab|2|29953979|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|While high gait variability is emerging as an early indicator of dementing illnesses, there is little research on whether high gait variability predicts cognitive decline in cognitively normal elderly who have no evidence of cognitive impairment.
29953979|ab|3|29953979|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In this 4-year prospective cohort study on 91 community-dwelling cognitively normal elderly individuals without cerebral ischemic burden or Parkinsonism, we evaluated gait speed and step time variability using a tri-axial accelerometer placed on the center of body mass, and diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) according to the International Working Group on MCI.
29953979|ab|4|29953979|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We performed Kaplan-Meier analysis with consecutive log-rank testing for MCI-free survival by cohort-specific tertiles of gait speed; hazard ratios (HR) of incident MCI were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, education level, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score, GDS score, and presence of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele.
29953979|ab|5|29953979|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Out of the 91 participants in the baseline assessment, 87 completed one or more 2-year follow-up assessments, and the median duration of follow-up was 47.1 months.
29953979|ab|6|29953979|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Kaplan-Meier curves of incident MCI show evident differences in risk by gait variability group (chi2 = 9.64, p = 0.002, log-rank test).
29953979|ab|7|29953979|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean MCI-free survival in the high variability group was 12% shorter than in the mid-to-low tertile group (47.4 +/- 1.74 [SD] vs. 54.04 +/- 0.52 months), while it was comparable between gait speed groups (51.59 +/- 0.70 vs. 50.64 +/- 1.77 months; chi2 = 1.16, p = 0.281).
29953979|ab|8|29953979|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In multivariate analysis, subjects with high gait variability showed about 12-fold higher risk of MCI (HR = 11.97, 95% CI = 1.29-111.37) than those with mid-to-low variability.
29953979|ab|9|29953979|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, those with slow gait speed showed comparable MCI risk to those with mid-to-high speed (HR = 5.04, 95% CI = 0.53-48.18).
29953979|ab|10|29953979|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Gait variability may be a better predictor of cognitive decline than gait speed in cognitively normal elderly individuals without cerebral ischemic burden or Parkinsonism.
28887422|ab|1|28887422||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Hanseniaspora uvarum (anamorph Kloeckera apiculata) is a predominant yeast on wine grapes and other fruits and has a strong influence on wine quality, even when Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter cultures are employed.
28887422|ab|2|28887422||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|In this work, we sequenced and annotated approximately 93% of the H. uvarum genome.
28887422|ab|3|28887422||METHODS|METHODS|Southern and synteny analyses were employed to construct a map of the seven chromosomes present in a type strain.
28887422|ab|4|28887422||RESULTS|RESULTS|Comparative determinations of specific enzyme activities within the fermentative pathway in H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae indicated that the reduced capacity of the former yeast for ethanol production is caused primarily by an approximately 10-fold-lower activity of the key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase.
28887422|ab|5|28887422||RESULTS|RESULTS|The heterologous expression of the encoding gene, H. uvarumPYK1 (HuPYK1), and two genes encoding the phosphofructokinase subunits, HuPFK1 and HuPFK2, in the respective deletion mutants of S. cerevisiae confirmed their functional homology.
28887422|ab|6|28887422||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|IMPORTANCEHanseniaspora uvarum is a predominant yeast species on grapes and other fruits.
28887422|ab|7|28887422||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|It contributes significantly to the production of desired as well as unfavorable aroma compounds and thus determines the quality of the final product, especially wine.
28887422|ab|8|28887422||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|Despite this obvious importance, knowledge on its genetics is scarce.
28887422|ab|9|28887422||RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|As a basis for targeted metabolic modifications, here we provide the results of a genomic sequencing approach, including the annotation of 3,010 protein-encoding genes, e.g., those encoding the entire sugar fermentation pathway, key components of stress response signaling pathways, and enzymes catalyzing the production of aroma compounds.
28887422|ab|10|28887422||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Comparative analyses suggest that the low fermentative capacity of H. uvarum compared to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be attributed to low pyruvate kinase activity.
28887422|ab|11|28887422||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The data reported here are expected to aid in establishing H. uvarum as a non-Saccharomyces yeast in starter cultures for wine and cider fermentations.

29858160|ab|2|29858160|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The literature on speech-evoked auditory brainstem response evoked by binaural stimulation is in fact limited.
29858160|ab|3|29858160|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Gender disparities in speech-evoked auditory brainstem response results have been consistently noted but the magnitude of gender difference has not been reported.
29858160|ab|4|29858160|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The present study aimed to compare the magnitude of gender difference in speech-evoked auditory brainstem response results between monaural and binaural stimulations.
29858160|ab|5|29858160|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 34 healthy Asian adults aged 19-30 years participated in this comparative study.
29858160|ab|6|29858160|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Eighteen of them were females (mean age=23.6+/-2.3 years) and the remaining sixteen were males (mean age=22.0+/-2.3 years).
29858160|ab|7|29858160|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|For each subject, speech-evoked auditory brainstem response was recorded with the synthesized syllable /da/ presented monaurally and binaurally.
29858160|ab|8|29858160|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|While latencies were not affected (p>0.05), the binaural stimulation produced statistically higher speech-evoked auditory brainstem response amplitudes than the monaural stimulation (p<0.05).
29858160|ab|9|29858160|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|As revealed by large effect sizes (d>0.80), substantive gender differences were noted in most of speech-evoked auditory brainstem response peaks for both stimulation modes.
29858160|ab|10|29858160|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The magnitude of gender difference between the two stimulation modes revealed some distinct patterns.
29858160|ab|11|29858160|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Based on these clinically significant results, gender-specific normative data are highly recommended when using speech-evoked auditory brainstem response for clinical and future applications.
29858160|ab|12|29858160|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The preliminary normative data provided in the present study can serve as the reference for future studies on this test among Asian adults.
29140092|ab|1|29140092||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Family 1 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) in plants primarily form glucose conjugates of small molecules and, besides other functions, play a role in detoxification of xenobiotics.
29140092|ab|2|29140092||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Indeed, overexpression of a barley UGT in wheat has been shown to control Fusarium head blight, which is a plant disease of global significance that leads to reduced crop yields and contamination with trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2 toxin, and many other structural variants.
29140092|ab|3|29140092||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The UGT Os79 from rice has emerged as a promising candidate for inactivation of mycotoxins because of its ability to glycosylate DON, nivalenol, and hydrolyzed T-2 toxin (HT-2).
29140092|ab|4|29140092||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, Os79 is unable to modify T-2 toxin (T-2), produced by pathogens such as Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium langsethii.
29140092|ab|5|29140092||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Activity toward T-2 is desirable because it would allow a single UGT to inactivate co-occurring mycotoxins.
29140092|ab|6|29140092||RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|Here, the structure of Os79 in complex with the products UDP and deoxynivalenol 3-O-glucoside is reported together with a kinetic analysis of a broad range of trichothecene mycotoxins.
29140092|ab|7|29140092||RESULTS|RESULTS|Residues associated with the trichothecene binding pocket were examined by site-directed mutagenesis that revealed that trichothecenes substituted at the C4 position, which are not glycosylated by wild-type Os79, can be accommodated in the binding pocket by increasing its volume.
29140092|ab|8|29140092||RESULTS|RESULTS|The H122A/L123A/Q202L triple mutation, which increases the volume of the active site and attenuates polar contacts, led to strong and equivalent activity toward trichothecenes with C4 acetyl groups.
29140092|ab|9|29140092||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This mutant enzyme provides the broad specificity required to control multiple toxins produced by different Fusarium species and chemotypes.

29953969|ab|2|29953969|BACKGROUND/AIMS|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|In addition, the risk of CHD is strongly associated with the low activity of paraoxonase-1 (PON1), whose 3'-UTR harbors an rs3735590 polymorphism.
29953969|ab|3|29953969|BACKGROUND/AIMS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to investigate whether the rs3735590 polymorphism could be used as a prognosis marker in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients undergoing CABG.
29953969|ab|4|29953969|BACKGROUND/AIMS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In addition, the hypothesis, i.e., the rs3735590 polymorphism may be involved in the regulation of PON1 gene expression via modulating its interaction with miRNAs, was tested in this study.
29953969|ab|5|29953969|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|292 patients diagnosed with COPD and treated with CABG were recruited for this study.
29953969|ab|6|29953969|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Genomic DNA was extracted from clinical samples, and real-time quantitative PCR and Western-blot were used to measure the expression of miR-616 and PON1 in liver cells of different genotypes.
29953969|ab|7|29953969|RESULTS|RESULTS|METHODS|292 COPD patients were divided into three groups according to their genotypes, i.e., rs3735590: CC (212), TC (75), and TT (5), respectively (TC and TT were merged in one group of T carriers for statistical analyses).
29953969|ab|8|29953969|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Patients with the CC genotype were associated with a shorter event-free survival time as compared to patients with the T genotypes.
29953969|ab|9|29953969|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, PON1 was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-616, while experiments with primary cells of different genotypes showed that miR-616 inhibited the expression of PON1 in CC cells.
29953969|ab|10|29953969|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|On the contrary, rs3735590 impaired such inhibitory effect of miR-616 in TT cells.
29953969|ab|11|29953969|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The rs3735590 polymorphism of PON1 acts as a prognostic biomarker in COPD patients treated by CABG.
29953040|ab|1|29953040|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the basal nuclei, causing motor and cognitive disorders.
29953040|ab|2|29953040|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Bearing in mind that standard treatments are ineffective in delaying the disease progression, alternative treatments capable of eliminating symptoms and reversing the clinical condition have been sought.
29953040|ab|3|29953040|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Possible alternative treatments include cell therapy, especially with the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).
29953040|ab|4|29953040|REVIEW SUMMARY|RESULTS|BACKGROUND|MSC are adult stem cells which have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic power in parkinsonian animals due to their differentiation competence, migratory capacity and the production of bioactive molecules.
29953040|ab|5|29953040|REVIEW SUMMARY|RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|This review aims to analyze the main studies involving MSC and PD in more than a decade of studies, addressing their different methodologies and common characteristics, as well as suggesting perspectives on the application of MSC in PD.
29953040|ab|6|29953040|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The results of MSC therapy in animal models and some clinical trials suggest that such cellular therapy may slow the progression of PD and promote neuroregeneration.
29953040|ab|7|29953040|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|However, further research is needed to address the limitations of an eventual clinical application.
28384277|ab|1|28384277||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The prevalence of low back disorders is dramatically high in viticulture.
28384277|ab|2|28384277||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Field measurements that objectively quantify work exposure can provide information on the relationship between the adopted trunk postures and low back pain.
28384277|ab|3|28384277||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The purposes of the present study were three-fold (1) to carry out a kinematics analysis of vineyard-workers' pruning activity by extracting the duration of bending and rotation of the trunk, (2) to question separately the relationship between the duration of forward bending or trunk rotation with low back pain intensity and pressure pain sensitivity and (3) to question the relationship between the combined duration of forward bending and trunk rotation on low back pain intensity and pressure pain sensitivity.
28384277|ab|4|28384277||METHODS|METHODS|Fifteen vineyard-workers were asked to perform pruning activity for 12 minutes with a wireless triaxial accelerometer placed on their trunk.
28384277|ab|5|28384277||RESULTS|RESULTS|Kinematic analysis of the trunk showed that vineyard-workers spent more than 50% of the time with the trunk flexed greater than 30 degrees and more than 20% with the trunk rotated greater than 10 degrees . These results show that pruning activity lead to the adoption of forward bended and rotated trunk postures that could significantly increase the risk of work related musculoskeletal disorders in the low back.
28384277|ab|6|28384277||RESULTS|RESULTS|However, this result was mitigated by the observation of an absence of significant association between the duration of forward bending and trunk rotation with low back pain intensity or pressure pain sensitivity.
28384277|ab|7|28384277||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Even if prospective field measurements and studies assessing the effects of low back pain confounders are needed, this field study provides new genuine information on trunk kinematics during pruning activity.

29803758|ab|2|29803758|AIMS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We investigated neuroendocrine cells in J-pouches of patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.
29803758|ab|3|29803758|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Sections from pouch biopsies of 17 patients and ileal biopsies of 17 active IBD patients and 16 controls were processed by immunohistochemistry for chromogranin A (CgA) and serotonin.
29803758|ab|4|29803758|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Mucosal tryptophan hydroxylase (TpH)-1 and serotonin-selective reuptake transporter (SERT) transcripts were measured by quantitative RT-PCR.
29803758|ab|5|29803758|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|TpH-1 and SERT transcripts were detected in pouch biopsies cultured with infliximab or its isotype control, while interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were measured in biopsy supernatants.
29803758|ab|6|29803758|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A significant increase in CgA-positive cells and serotonin-positive cells was observed in both pouch and IBD ileum compared to control ileum.
29803758|ab|7|29803758|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Significantly raised transcripts of TpH-1, but not SERT, were found in IBD ileum in comparison to control ileum, with no significant difference between pouch and IBD ileum.
29803758|ab|8|29803758|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Infliximab had no influence on ex vivo pouch expression of TpH-1 and SERT, nor on the production of IL-6 and IL-8.

28466653|ab|1|28466653||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This review aims to summarize the currently available evidence for the role of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy in the management of cholangiocarcinoma.
28466653|ab|2|28466653||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|High locoregional disease recurrence rates after surgical resection alone for both the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) provide a rationale for using adjuvant radiotherapy with chemotherapy.

28466653|ab|4|28466653||METHODS|METHODS|The role of radiation is discussed in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, definitive and the palliative setting.
28466653|ab|5|28466653||RESULTS|RESULTS|Evidence from Phase II trials have demonstrated efficacy of adjuvant chemoradiation in combination with chemotherapy in EHCC.
28466653|ab|6|28466653||RESULTS|RESULTS|Locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma may be treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
28466653|ab|7|28466653||RESULTS|RESULTS|In the case of downsizing, assessment for resection may be considered.

28877231|ab|1|28877231||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The palatine tonsils, localized in the oropharynx, are easily accessible secondary lymphoid tissue in humans.
28877231|ab|2|28877231||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Inflammation of the palatine tonsils, local and chronic in case of chronic tonsillitis (CT) or acute in the presence of a peritonsillar abscess (PTA), ranks among the most common diseases in otolaryngology.
28877231|ab|3|28877231||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, the functionality of tonsillar immune cells, notably T-cells, in the context of these immune pathologies is poorly understood.
28877231|ab|4|28877231||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We have examined the functional status of human tonsillar T-cells in CT and compared it to the acute inflammatory setting of a PTA.
28877231|ab|5|28877231||METHODS|METHODS|Patients presenting with CT (n = 10) or unilateral PTA (n = 7) underwent bilateral tonsillectomy and a subgroup of 8 patients underwent additional blood sampling.
28877231|ab|6|28877231||METHODS|METHODS|T-cells were purified via automated magnetic selection and subjected to flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping.
28877231|ab|7|28877231||METHODS|METHODS|In addition, the response to T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation was assessed at the level of proximal signaling, activation marker expression and proliferation.
28877231|ab|8|28877231||RESULTS|RESULTS|We observed no difference between the percentage of T helper (CD4(+)) cells from tonsil tissue in CT and PTA, but observed a trend towards a higher percentage of T helper cells in the blood of patients with PTA versus CT, probably reflecting an acute, systemic bacterial infection in the former cohort.
28877231|ab|9|28877231||RESULTS|RESULTS|Tonsils from CT harbored more PD-1(+) CD4(+) T-cells, pointing to T-cell exhaustion due to chronic infection.
28877231|ab|10|28877231||RESULTS|RESULTS|This notion was supported by functional studies that showed a tendency to weaker TCR responses of tonsillar T-cells from CT.
28877231|ab|11|28877231||RESULTS|RESULTS|Intriguingly, tonsillar T-cells recurrently featured a dampened response to T-cell receptor stimulation at the level of receptor proximal signaling steps compared to peripheral T-cells.
28877231|ab|12|28877231||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In sum, our study documents distinct differences in tonsillar T-cell class distribution and function between the various pathological conditions.
28877231|ab|13|28877231||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our observations are consistent with the concept that tonsillar T-cells react to infections by eliciting specific immunological responses in chronic versus acute settings of inflammation.
27600135|ab|1|27600135||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Non-clinical dose formulations (also known as pre-clinical or GLP formulations) play a key role in early drug development.
27600135|ab|2|27600135||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|These formulations are used to introduce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into test organisms for both pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies.
27600135|ab|3|27600135||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Since these studies are ultimately used to support dose and safety ranges in human studies, it is important to understand not only the concentration and PK/PD of the active ingredient but also to generate safety data for likely process impurities and degradation products of the active ingredient.
27600135|ab|4|27600135||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|As such, many in the industry have chosen to develop and validate methods which can accurately detect and quantify the active ingredient along with impurities and degradation products.
27600135|ab|5|27600135||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|Such methods often provide trendable results which are predictive of stability, thus leading to the name; stability indicating methods.
27600135|ab|6|27600135||CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|This document provides an overview of best practices for those choosing to include development and validation of such methods as part of their non-clinical drug development program.
27600135|ab|7|27600135||CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|This document is intended to support teams who are either new to stability indicating method development and validation or who are less familiar with the requirements of validation due to their position within the product development life cycle.
27040720|ab|1|27040720||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Statistical species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to project spatial relocations of marine taxa under future climate change scenarios.
27040720|ab|2|27040720||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, tests of their predictive skill in the real-world are rare.
27040720|ab|3|27040720||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Here, we use data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder program, one of the longest running and most extensive marine biological monitoring programs, to investigate the reliability of predicted plankton distributions.
27040720|ab|4|27040720||METHODS|METHODS|We apply three commonly used SDMs to 20 representative plankton species, including copepods, diatoms, and dinoflagellates, all found in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas.
27040720|ab|5|27040720||METHODS|METHODS|We fit the models to decadal subsets of the full (1958-2012) dataset, and then use them to predict both forward and backward in time, comparing the model predictions against the corresponding observations.
27040720|ab|6|27040720||RESULTS|RESULTS|The probability of correctly predicting presence was low, peaking at 0.5 for copepods, and model skill typically did not outperform a null model assuming distributions to be constant in time.
27040720|ab|7|27040720||RESULTS|RESULTS|The predicted prevalence increasingly differed from the observed prevalence for predictions with more distance in time from their training dataset.
27040720|ab|8|27040720||RESULTS|RESULTS|More detailed investigations based on four focal species revealed that strong spatial variations in skill exist, with the least skill at the edges of the distributions, where prevalence is lowest.
27040720|ab|9|27040720||RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, the scores of traditional single-value model performance metrics were contrasting and some implied overoptimistic conclusions about model skill.
27040720|ab|10|27040720||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Plankton may be particularly challenging to model, due to its short life span and the dispersive effects of constant water movements on all spatial scales, however there are few other studies against which to compare these results.
27040720|ab|11|27040720||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We conclude that rigorous model validation, including comparison against null models, is essential to assess the robustness of projections of marine planktonic species under climate change.

29803375|ab|1|29803375|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Children are more sensitive to ionizing radiation effects due to their high radiosensitivity.
29803375|ab|2|29803375|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To estimate doses and risks for dental radiological examinations in children.
29803375|ab|3|29803375|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A pediatric population consisting of 7150 children and young adults which underwent 12252 dental radiological examinations (4220 intraoral, 1324 cephalometric, 5284 panoramic radiographs and 1424 CBCTs) within two years were included.
29803375|ab|4|29803375|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Two groups were studied: CBCT group (exposed to CBCT+/-conventional radiographs) and 2D group (exposed only to 2D radiological examinations).
29803375|ab|5|29803375|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The effective doses were corrected according to age at exposure and settings parameters (mA;FOV) by using logarithmic fit equations for dose interpolation.
29803375|ab|6|29803375|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The individual cumulative dose, per-caput collective dose and radiation risk were calculated for each group.
29803375|ab|7|29803375|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The median effective and cumulative doses for conventional radiographs were lower than 20muSv and did not vary with age.

28549600|ab|1|28549600||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|We developed an intravaginal instrumented probe (covered with a 10x10 matrix of capacitive sensors) for assessing the three-dimensional (3D) spatiotemporal pressure profile of the vaginal canal.
28549600|ab|2|28549600||OBJECTIVE|METHODS|The pressure profile was compared to the pelvic floor (PF) digital assessment, and the reliability of the instrument and repeatability of the protocol was tested.
28549600|ab|3|28549600||METHODS|METHODS|We also tested its ability to characterize and differentiate two tasks: PF maximum contraction and Valsalva maneuver (maximum intra-abdominal effort with downward movement of the PF).
28549600|ab|4|28549600||METHODS|METHODS|Peak pressures were calculated for the total matrix, for three major sub-regions, and for 5 planes and 10 rings throughout the vaginal canal.
28549600|ab|5|28549600||RESULTS|RESULTS|Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated excellent inter- and intra-rater reliability and intra-trial repeatability for the total and medial areas, with moderate reliability for the cranial and caudal areas.
28549600|ab|6|28549600||RESULTS|RESULTS|There was a moderate correlation between peak pressure and PF digital palpation [Spearman's coefficient r=0.55 (p<0.001)].
28549600|ab|7|28549600||RESULTS|RESULTS|Spatiotemporal profiles were completely different between tasks (2-way ANOVAs for repeated measures) with notably higher pressures (above 30kPa) for the maximum contraction task compared to Valsalva (below 15kPa).
28549600|ab|8|28549600||RESULTS|RESULTS|At maximum contraction, higher pressures occurred in the mid-antero-posterior zone, with earlier peak pressure onsets and more variable along the vaginal depth (from rings 3 to 10-caudal).
28549600|ab|9|28549600||RESULTS|RESULTS|During Valsalva, the highest pressures were observed in rings 4-6, with peak pressure onsets more synchronized between rings.
28549600|ab|10|28549600||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|With this protocol and novel instrument, we obtained a high-resolution and highly reliable innovative 3D pressure distribution map of the PF capable of distinguishing vaginal sub-regions, planes, rings and tasks.

28177177|ab|1|28177177||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Camel milk has a unique composition with naturally occurring heavy-chain antibodies (HCAbs), which exert rehabilitating potencies in infection and immunity.
28177177|ab|2|28177177||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To characterize HCAb in camel milk, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was isolated from the milk of Camelus bactrianus by a combination of affinity chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to purify and size-fractionate protein A and protein G, which were further identified by Western blotting, and were quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) and ELISA.
28177177|ab|3|28177177||METHODS|RESULTS|The results indicated that IgG1 fraction contains molecules of 50 kDa heavy chains and 36 kDa light chains.
28177177|ab|4|28177177||RESULTS|RESULTS|The HCAbs (IgG2 and IgG3 fractions) devoid of light chains, contain heavy chains of 45 kDa and 43 kDa, respectively, the amounts of which were significantly higher than that of the IgG1 in the milk of bactrian camels.
28177177|ab|5|28177177||RESULTS|RESULTS|Above all, we revealed the considerable amounts of HCAbs in the milk of bactrian camels, and developed a novel method for their purification and quantification.
28177177|ab|6|28177177||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings provide the basis for developing potential effects of camel milk and its interface with the dairy industry, as well as future investigations of HCAb and its roles in human health and diseases.
27773768|ab|1|27773768||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Two enveloped virus families, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae, comprise a large number of dangerous pathogens that enter the host cell via fusion of their envelope with a target cell membrane at acidic or neutral pH.
27773768|ab|2|27773768||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The Class I prototypic glycoproteins responsible for this reaction are the Influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) protein or paramyxovirus fusion (F) protein.
27773768|ab|3|27773768||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy data are available for the HA and F ectodomains in pre- and post-fusion conformations, revealing similar spiky architectures, albeit with clear differences in the details.
27773768|ab|4|27773768||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|In contrast, their anchoring segments, which possess a linker region, transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail that is specifically modified with long fatty acids (highly conserved in HA and occasional in F), are not resolved.
27773768|ab|5|27773768||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Recent experimental, bioinformatics and molecular modelling data showing the primary, secondary and quaternary organization of the HA and F anchoring segments are summarized in this review.
27773768|ab|6|27773768||RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|Some amino acid patterns that are crucial for protein thermal stability or lipid membrane order/cholesterol binding are addressed, and new achievements in vaccine practice using HA transmembrane domain chimaeras are discussed.
27773768|ab|7|27773768||RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|The oligomerization properties of the transmembrane domains are considered in the context of Group-1 and Group-2 antigenic HA subtypes and various genera/subfamilies of paramyxoviruses.
27773768|ab|8|27773768||CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|A specific focus is the late steps of fusion that are reportedly facilitated by (1) beta-sheet-promoting beta-branched amino acids (valine and isoleucine) that are enriched in the transmembrane domain of paramyxovirus F or (2) a post-translational modification of C-terminal cysteines with palmitate/stearate (differential S-acylation) that is highly conserved in Influenza virus HA.
29953849|ab|1|29953849|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To determine the change in vision and retinal structure in patients with the common c.2299delG mutation in the USH2A gene in anticipation of clinical trials of therapy.
29953849|ab|2|29953849|DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|Retrospective observational case series.
29953849|ab|3|29953849|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Eighteen patients, homozygotes or compound heterozygotes with the c.2299delG mutation in USH2A, were studied with regard to visual acuity, kinetic perimetry, dark- and light-adapted static perimetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and autofluorescence (AF) imaging.
29953849|ab|4|29953849|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Serial data were available for at least half of the patients, depending on the parameter analyzed.
29953849|ab|5|29953849|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The kinetics of disease progression in this specific molecular form of USH2A differed between the measured parameters.
29953849|ab|6|29953849|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Visual acuity could remain normal for decades.
29953849|ab|7|29953849|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Kinetic and light-adapted static perimetry across the entire visual field had similar rates of decline that were slower than those of rod-based perimetry.
29953849|ab|8|29953849|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Horizontal OCT scans through the macula showed that inner segment/outer segment line width had a similar rate of constriction as co-localized AF imaging and cone-based light-adapted sensitivity extent.
29953849|ab|9|29953849|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The rate of constriction of rod-based sensitivity extent across this same region was twice as rapid as that of cones.
29953849|ab|10|29953849|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In patients with the c.2299delG mutation in USH2A, rod photoreceptors are the cells that express disease early and more aggressively than cones.
29953849|ab|11|29953849|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Rod-based vision measurements in central or extracentral-peripheral retinal regions warrant monitoring in order to complete a clinical trial in a timely manner.
29956872|ab|1|29956872|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Given the limited alleviation of chronic pain with pharmacological treatments, various nonpharmacological and self-care approaches are often proposed that require patients' motivation.

29956872|ab|5|29956872|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Among the 1524 eligible patients, 639 (41.9%) were included.
29956872|ab|6|29956872|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The median pain duration was 8.5 years (interquartile range = 7.5).
29956872|ab|7|29956872|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Two-thirds (63.7%) of the patients reported high pain-related disability, and 64.6% had used opioids during the previous six months.
29956872|ab|8|29956872|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Most patients had a high (44.1%) or moderate (24.6%) LOR to practise active self-care.
29956872|ab|9|29956872|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Multivariable multinomial regression analysis showed that independent factors associated with a high LOR were a higher level of education (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.90-6.13, p < 0.001), unemployed status due to medical condition (RRR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.30-6.56, p = 0.009), the use of dietary supplements 'against pain' (RRR = 2.77, 95% CI: 1.52-5.04, p = 0.001) and neuropathic pain characteristics (RRR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.40-3.12, p = 0.036).
29956872|ab|10|29956872|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Older age was a factor predicting a lower LOR (RRR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99, p = 0.039).
29956872|ab|11|29956872|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Long-term chronic pain, severe pain-related disability and the presence of a mood disorder were not associated with a lower LOR.
29956872|ab|12|29956872|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Most chronic pain patients, including those severely affected, indicated their readiness to practise active self-care methods.
29956872|ab|13|29956872|SIGNIFICANCE|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Most chronic pain patients, even those severely affected, appeared to be ready to practise active self-care therapies and we believe that further studies are needed to investigate their impact on pain and quality of life.
29956389|ab|1|29956389|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Pelvic exenteration (PE) in carefully selected gynecologic cancer patients has a 5-year survival rate as high as 60%.
29956389|ab|2|29956389|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Thus, there is a growing number of PE survivors dealing with the effects of this radical surgery.
29956389|ab|3|29956389|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The current study sought to explore women's physical, psychological, and social quality of life (QOL) after PE.
29956389|ab|4|29956389|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Fourteen women who had undergone PE for recurrent gynecologic cancer at least 1 year previously completed semistructured qualitative interviews designed to elicit expectations and experiences of QOL following PE.
29956389|ab|5|29956389|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Thematic analysis was used to code transcripts for both a priori and emergent themes.
29956389|ab|6|29956389|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Themes included PE versus palliative care, preparedness, persistent symptoms, the not so normal new normal, new rules of social engagement, support, emotional diversity, and bouncing back through adaptive coping.
29956389|ab|7|29956389|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Key differences with previous studies include the explicit acknowledgement of the need for palliative care, the chronic nature of multiple, seemingly unaddressed physical symptoms in survivorship, and the predominance of positive psychological symptoms.
29956389|ab|8|29956389|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|While a minority expressed emotional distress and regret for undergoing PE, most articulated a sense of resilience gained through a variety of adaptive coping strategies.
29956389|ab|9|29956389|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Findings underscore the persistent physical, psychological, and social effects of PE on QOL and the need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary patient care before and long after surgery.
29956389|ab|10|29956389|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Findings should promote development of a best practice clinical pathway for the care and education of women who undergo PE with curative intent for gynecologic cancer.

27930720|ab|1|27930720||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Voluntary medical male circumcision is an integral part of the South African government's response to the HIV and AIDS epidemic.
27930720|ab|2|27930720||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Following circumcision, it is recommended that patients abstain from sexual activity for six weeks, as sex may increase the risk of female-to-male HIV transmission and prolong the healing period.
27930720|ab|3|27930720||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This paper investigates the resumption of sexual activity during the healing period among a cohort of school-going males in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.
27930720|ab|4|27930720||RESULTS|METHODS|The analysis for this paper compares two groups of sexually active school-going males: the first group reported having sex during the healing period (n = 40) and the second group (n = 98) reported no sex during the healing period (mean age: 17.7, SD: 1.7).
27930720|ab|5|27930720||RESULTS|RESULTS|The results show that 29% (n = 40) of young males (mean age: 17.9, SD: 1.8) who were previously sexually active, resumed sexual activity during the healing period, had on average two partners and used condoms inconsistently.
27930720|ab|6|27930720||RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, those males that engage in sexual activity during the healing period were less inclined to practice safe sex in the future (AOR = 0.055, p = 0.002) than the group of males who reported no sex during the healing period.
27930720|ab|7|27930720||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings suggest that a significant proportion of young males may currently and in the future, subject themselves to high levels of risk for contracting HIV post circumcision.
27930720|ab|8|27930720||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Education, as part of a VMMC campaign, must emphasize the high risk of HIV transmission for both the males their partners during the healing period.

29954674|ab|2|29954674|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 353 women with breast cancer who had undergone NAC were included.
29954674|ab|3|29954674|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Pathologic examination after complete surgical excision was the reference standard.
29954674|ab|4|29954674|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Tumors were divided into 4 subtypes on the basis of expression of hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
29954674|ab|5|29954674|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Tumor enhancement was assessed on early and late phases of MRI.
29954674|ab|6|29954674|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|MRI negativity was divided into radiologic complete response (rCR, complete absence of enhancement on both early and late phases) and near-rCR (no discernible early enhancement but observed late enhancement).
29954674|ab|7|29954674|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Ninety (25.5%) of 353 patients experienced pathologic complete response.
29954674|ab|8|29954674|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|When analyzing the data of all patients, sensitivity of MRI was higher for rCR versus near-rCR (97.72% vs. 90.49%, P < .0001), whereas specificity was lower for rCR versus near-rCR (44.44% vs. 72.22%, P < .0001).
29954674|ab|9|29954674|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Accuracy was equivalent (84.14% vs. 85.84%).
29954674|ab|10|29954674|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In HR-HER2(+) tumors, 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value were achieved by assessing early enhancement only.

29954839|ab|9|29954839|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|However, clinicians must weigh the potential for missed bacteremia in non-ill-appearing infants discharged within 24 hours against the overall low prevalence of infection.
29843126|ab|1|29843126|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Relatively little is known regarding the association between objective measures of physical function such as cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and cognitive function tests in healthy older adults.
29843126|ab|2|29843126|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To evaluate the relationship between CRF and cognitive function in adults aged 55 and older.
29843126|ab|3|29843126|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Between 2008 and 2017, 4,931 men and women underwent a comprehensive preventive physical exam at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas.
29843126|ab|4|29843126|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|CRF was determined by duration of a maximal treadmill exercise test.
29843126|ab|5|29843126|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Cognitive function was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
29843126|ab|6|29843126|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In a multivariate model, adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for MoCA scores < 26 (i.e., cognitive impairment) were determined by using CRF as both a continuous and a categorical variable.
29843126|ab|7|29843126|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean age of the sample was 61.0 +/- 6.0 years; mean maximal MET values were 10.0 +/- 2.2.
29843126|ab|8|29843126|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean MoCA scores were 26.9 +/- 2.2; 23.4% of the sample had MoCA scores indicative of cognitive impairment.
29843126|ab|9|29843126|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The odds ratio for cognitive impairment was 0.93 (0.88-0.97) per 1-MET increment in CRF.
29843126|ab|10|29843126|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|When examined as a categorical variable, and using the lowest CRF quintile as the referent, there was a significantly reduced likelihood for cognitive impairment across the remaining ordered CRF categories (p trend = 0.004).
29843126|ab|11|29843126|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The association between CRF and MoCA score in older adults suggests that meeting or exceeding public health guidelines for physical activity is likely to increase CRF in low fit individuals, maintain CRF in those with a moderate to high level of CRF, and thereby help to maintain cognitive function in healthy older adults.

29956607|ab|1|29956607|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Snake venom, a highly poisonous and active venomous snake's secretion, is a complex mixture of inorganic cations, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, peptides, toxins and hydrolytic enzymes of importance including Phosphodiesterases (PDEs).
29956607|ab|2|29956607|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|These snake venom hydrolytic enzymes interfere in different physiological processes.
29956607|ab|3|29956607|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Snake venom PDEs have several roles to metabolize extracellular nucleotides and to regulate nucleotide based intercellular signalling mechanisms including platelet aggregation, which can lead to death and debilitation in cardiac arrest and strokes in patients having cerebro-vascular and cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and atherosclerosis which is the primary cause of life-threatening diseases such as, stroke and myocardial-infarction.
29956607|ab|4|29956607|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|PDEs are used to synthesize modified oligonucleotides, which are useful in potential therapeutic applications.
29956607|ab|5|29956607|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|Characterization of PDEs from different snake venoms has potential in identifying new anticoagulants that target specific active sites, which leads to the treatment of haemostatic disorders.
29956607|ab|6|29956607|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|Here, we review the snake venom PDEs potential therapeutic activity against platelet aggregation which could provide ideal platforms to design drugs for treatment or to fight against unwanted clots formation.
29788393|ab|1|29788393|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Epidemiology can assess the effect of Chiari I malformation (CM1) on the neurological health of a population and evaluate factors influencing CM1 development.
29788393|ab|2|29788393|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To analyze the regional and ethnic differences in the prevalence of CM1.
29788393|ab|3|29788393|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The population of the Republic of Tatarstan (RT) in the Russian Federation was evaluated for patients with CM1 symptoms over an 11-yr period.
29788393|ab|4|29788393|METHODS|METHODS|RESULTS|Typical symptoms of CM1 were found in 868 patients.
29788393|ab|5|29788393|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Data from neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurement of posterior cranial fossa structures were analyzed.
29788393|ab|6|29788393|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|MRI evidence of CM1, defined as cerebellar tonsils lying at least 5 mm inferior to the foramen magnum, was found in 67% of symptomatic patients.
29788393|ab|7|29788393|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Another 33% of symptomatic patients had 2 to 4 mm of tonsillar ectopia, which we defined as "borderline Chiari malformation type 1 (bCM1)."
29788393|ab|8|29788393|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The period prevalence in the entire RT for symptomatic CM1 was 20:100 000; for bCM1 was 10:100 000; and for CM1 and bCM1 together was 30:100 000.
29788393|ab|9|29788393|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Prevalence of patients with CM1 symptoms was greater in the northern than southern districts of Tatarstan, due to a high prevalence (413:100 000) of CM1 in the Baltasy region in one of the northern districts.
29788393|ab|10|29788393|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|One-third of patients with typical symptoms of CM1 had less than 5 mm of tonsillar ectopia (bCM1).
29788393|ab|11|29788393|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Assessments of the health impact of CM1-type symptoms on a patient population should include the bCM1 patient group.

29954427|ab|1|29954427|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Aorto-left ventricular tunnel (ALVT) is a rare congenital extracardiac channel that connects the ascending aorta to the left ventricle.
29954427|ab|2|29954427|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|To our knowledge, no case has been thus far reported as ALVT with both anomalous origin of right coronary artery (AORCA) and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV).
29954427|ab|3|29954427|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We reported a case of a 5-year-old female diagnosed as ALVT with accompanying AORCA and BAV which had been previously misdiagnosed as aortic regurgitation (AR) triggered by BAV.
29954427|ab|4|29954427|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Additionally, a special modality of ALVT was confirmed in this case during the surgery in which the tunnel was formed by the separation between the roots of two aortic leaflets during the diastolic period.
29954427|ab|5|29954427|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|ALVT with both AORCA and BAV is clinically uncommon and the aberrant tunnel in ALVT can be formed by the gap between the roots of two aortic leaflets.
29954427|ab|6|29954427|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Besides, ALVT with BAV might easily lead to an inaccurate diagnose as aortic regurgitation caused by BAV.
29954427|ab|7|29954427|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Cardiac surgeons should be alerted for differential diagnosis of ALVT with BAV and isolated bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) causing aortic regurgitation (AR).
27997269|ab|1|27997269||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It was recently shown that ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) could induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
27997269|ab|2|27997269||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|If ER stress is associated the toxicity of ZnO NPs, the presence of ER stress inducer thapsigargin (TG) should alter the response of HUVECs to ZnO NP exposure.
27997269|ab|3|27997269||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In this study, we addressed this issue by assessing cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in ZnO NP exposed HUVECs with or without the presence of TG.
27997269|ab|4|27997269||METHODS|METHODS|Moreover, TiO2 NPs were used to compare the effects.
27997269|ab|5|27997269||RESULTS|RESULTS|Exposure to 32 mug/mL ZnO NPs (p < 0.05), but not TiO2 NPs (p > 0.05), significantly induced cytotoxicity as assessed by WST-1 and neutral red uptake assay, as well as intracellular ROS.
27997269|ab|6|27997269||RESULTS|RESULTS|ZnO NPs dose-dependently increased the accumulation of intracellular Zn ions, and ZnSO4 induced similar cytotoxic effects as ZnO NPs, which indicated a role of Zn ions.
27997269|ab|7|27997269||RESULTS|RESULTS|The release of inflammatory proteins tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) or the adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to HUVECs was not significantly affected by ZnO or TiO2 NP exposure (p > 0.05).
27997269|ab|8|27997269||RESULTS|RESULTS|The presence of 250 nM TG significantly induced cytotoxicity, release of IL-6 and THP-1 monocyte adhesion (p < 0.01), but did not significantly affect intracellular ROS or release of TNFalpha (p > 0.05).
27997269|ab|9|27997269||RESULTS|RESULTS|ANOVA analysis indicated no interaction between exposure to ZnO NPs and the presence of TG on almost all the endpoints (p > 0.05) except neutral red uptake assay (p < 0.01).
27997269|ab|10|27997269||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We concluded ER stress is probably not associated with ZnO NP exposure induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in HUVECs.
27922664|ab|1|27922664||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is associated with sudden cardiac death and heart failure, resulting in a significant medical burden.
27922664|ab|2|27922664||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of DCM remain elusive.
27922664|ab|3|27922664||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|In the present study, human cardiac tissues from patients with DCM and healthy donors were collected and their pathology was examined.
27922664|ab|4|27922664||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|The expression levels of apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 and fibrosis-associated microRNAs were also evaluated.
27922664|ab|5|27922664||RESULTS|RESULTS|Extensive myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis in DCM cardiac tissues was observed.
27922664|ab|6|27922664||RESULTS|RESULTS|As demonstrated by western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, the expression of Bcl2 was significantly increased in the apex, and the left and right ventricle of the heart in patients with DCM.
27922664|ab|7|27922664||RESULTS|RESULTS|In the specified locations, it was identified that miR21 was upregulated, while members of miR29 family (miR29a, miR29b and miR29c) and miR133 family (miR-133a and miR-133b) were downregulated.
27922664|ab|8|27922664||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The present study suggested that Bcl2 and specific microRNAs may be involved in DCM pathogenesis, with a potential implication as therapeutic targets.
29097313|ab|1|29097313||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Free and ester forms of unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol are oxidized in vivo by multiple oxidants to give diverse products.
29097313|ab|2|29097313||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Some lipid oxidation is mediated by enzymes to selectively give specific products, while others proceed randomly to produce mixtures of many kinds of regioisomers and stereoisomers.
29097313|ab|3|29097313||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The efficacy of antioxidants against lipid oxidation depends on the nature of the oxidants and therefore the identification of oxidant is important for understanding the roles and effects of lipid oxidation and antioxidants in vivo.
29097313|ab|4|29097313||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In the present study, the isomer distribution of hydro(pero)xyoctadecadienoates (H(p)ODEs) and hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoates (H(p)ETEs), the most abundant lipid oxidation products found in human plasma, produced in the oxidation of plasma by peroxyl radicals, peroxynitrite, hypochlorite, 15-lipoxygenase, and singlet oxygen were examined.
29097313|ab|5|29097313||RESULTS|RESULTS|It was shown that 9- and 13-(E,E)-HODEs, 13(S)-(Z,E)-HODE, and 10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODEs were specific lipid oxidation products by free radical, 15-lipoxygenase, and singlet oxygen, respectively.
29097313|ab|6|29097313||RESULTS|RESULTS|The isomer distribution of HODEs produced by peroxynitrite was similar to that by peroxyl radical, suggesting that the peroxynitrite mediated lipid oxidation proceeds by free radical mechanisms.
29097313|ab|7|29097313||RESULTS|RESULTS|The production of HODEs and HETEs by hypochlorite was very small.
29097313|ab|8|29097313||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|HODEs may be a better biomarker than HETEs since linoleates are oxidized by simpler mechanisms than arachidonates and all the HODEs isomers can be quantified more easily.
29097313|ab|9|29097313||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These products may be used as specific biomarkers for the identification of responsible oxidants and for the assessment of oxidant-specific lipid oxidation levels and effects of antioxidants in vivo.
29793629|ab|1|29793629|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Inflammation contributes to chronic kidney disease (CKD), in part mediated through activation of interleukin (IL)-1beta by the NLRP3 inflammasome within the kidney.
29793629|ab|2|29793629|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|This process also likely contributes to the accelerated atherosclerosis associated with nephropathy.
29793629|ab|3|29793629|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The authors hypothesized that canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-1beta, might reduce cardiovascular event rates and improve renal function among post-myocardial infarction patients with CKD.

27633041|ab|1|27633041||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Many transcription factors and signaling molecules involved in the guidance of myogenic differentiation have been investigated in previous studies.
27633041|ab|2|27633041||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, the precise molecular mechanisms of myogenic differentiation remain largely unknown.
27633041|ab|3|27633041||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In the present study, by performing a meta-analysis of C2C12 myogenic differentiation microarray data, we found that leucine-rich repeat-containing 75B (Lrrc75b), also known as AI646023, a molecule of unknown biological function, was downregulated during C2C12 myogenic differentiation.
27633041|ab|4|27633041||RESULTS|RESULTS|The knockdown of Lrrc75b using specific siRNA in C2C12 myoblasts markedly enhanced the expression of muscle-speci fi c myogenin and increased myoblast fusion and the myotube diameter.
27633041|ab|5|27633041||RESULTS|RESULTS|By contrast, the adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Lrrc75b in C2C12 cells markedly inhibited myoblast differentiation accompanied by a decrease in myogenin expression.
27633041|ab|6|27633041||RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) was suppressed in the cells in which Lrrc75b was silenced.
27633041|ab|7|27633041||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Taken together, our results demonstrate that Lrrc75b is a novel suppressor of C2C12 myogenic differentiation by modulating myogenin and Erk1/2 signaling.

29843248|ab|1|29843248|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Huntington Disease (HD) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are both associated with neurodegeneration in the cerebral cortex and striatum.
29843248|ab|2|29843248|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The rate of striatal degeneration is a known predictor of symptom onset in HD indicating a potential neurobiological link between HD and HIV.
29843248|ab|3|29843248|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To determine if the presence of pre-existing HIV infection would trigger a significantly earlier age of symptom onset (ASO) in HD-mutation carriers when compared to non-infected HD subjects.
29843248|ab|4|29843248|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This was a retrospective analysis of the Enroll-HD database that included participants with a CAG repeat of at least 36.
29843248|ab|5|29843248|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Participants with HD and a comorbidity of HIV that was diagnosed prior to their reported ASO were identified and compared to participants with HD who did not have HIV.
29843248|ab|6|29843248|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|An ANCOVA analysis was performed to investigate the differences in ASO between the HIV and non-HIV groups.

29843248|ab|8|29843248|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The average ASO of HD subjects with previous HIV infection (n = 8) was 9.1 years earlier than non-HIV infected HD subjects (n = 3259) [F (1, 3267) =10.05, p = 0.002].
29843248|ab|9|29843248|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Despite low numbers of participants in the HIV group, the calculated effect size of this difference was 1.07.
29843248|ab|10|29843248|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The known neurobiological changes caused by HIV seem to hasten the ASO in patients with HD.

28278061|ab|1|28278061||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The study was designed to further the understanding of transphobia among students majoring in the helping professions including social work, occupational therapy, and nursing.
28278061|ab|2|28278061||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The study's hypotheses examined the effects of transgender content in education (e.g., textbooks and lectures), religiosity, contact with transgender people, and several sociodemographic variables with transphobia.
28278061|ab|3|28278061||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Differences in transphobia levels between social work students and those in aligned professions were also explored.
28278061|ab|4|28278061||METHODS|METHODS|The sample consisted of 600 students of a public, urban university in New York City who participated in an online survey.
28278061|ab|5|28278061||METHODS|METHODS|Measures included transphobia and transgender content scales.
28278061|ab|6|28278061||RESULTS|RESULTS|Students reported (75%) a deficient amount of transgender content in education, and almost one half of the sample reported moderate to high levels of transphobia.
28278061|ab|7|28278061||RESULTS|RESULTS|Other findings showed that transgender content in education was positively correlated with transphobia, and 1-way ANOVA showed that transphobia differed significantly across the majors.

27518137|ab|1|27518137||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The purpose of this report is to provide guidance on the use of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) as a clinical trial outcome measure for pharmaceutical interventions developed to prevent acquired hearing loss secondary to cochlear insult.
27518137|ab|2|27518137||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OAEs are a rapid, noninvasive measure that can be used to monitor cochlear outer hair cell function.
27518137|ab|3|27518137||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Serial monitoring of OAEs is most clearly established for use in hearing conservation and ototoxicity monitoring programs in which they exhibit more frequent and earlier changes compared with pure-tone audiometry.
27518137|ab|4|27518137||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|They also show promise in recent human trials of otoprotectants.
27518137|ab|5|27518137||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|Questions remain, however, concerning the most appropriate OAE protocols to use and what constitutes a "significant" OAE response change.
27518137|ab|6|27518137||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|Measurement system capabilities are expanding and test efficacy will vary across locations and patient populations.
27518137|ab|7|27518137||CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|Yet, standardizing minimal measurement criteria and reporting of results is needed including documentation of test-retest variability so that useful comparisons can be made across trials.
27518137|ab|8|27518137||CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|It is also clear that protocols must be theoretically sound based on known patterns of damage, generate valid results in most individuals tested, be accurate, repeatable, and involve minimal time.
27518137|ab|9|27518137||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Based on the potential value added, OAEs should be included in clinical trials when measurement conditions and time permit.
28814519|ab|1|28814519||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Gut-homing alpha4beta7(high) CD4(+) T lymphocytes have been shown to be preferentially targeted by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and are implicated in HIV-1 pathogenesis.
28814519|ab|2|28814519||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Previous studies demonstrated that HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 binds and signals through alpha4beta7 and that this likely contributes to the infection of alpha4beta7(high) T cells and promotes cell-to-cell virus transmission.
28814519|ab|3|28814519||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Structures within the second variable loop (V2) of gp120, including the tripeptide motif LDV/I, are thought to mediate gp120-alpha4beta7 binding.
28814519|ab|4|28814519||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, lack of alpha4beta7 binding has been reported in gp120 proteins containing LDV/I, and the precise determinants of gp120-alpha4beta7 binding are not fully defined.
28814519|ab|5|28814519||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In this work, we report the novel finding that fibronectins mediate indirect gp120-alpha4beta7 interactions.
28814519|ab|6|28814519||METHODS|RESULTS|We show that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells used to express recombinant gp120 produced fibronectins and other extracellular matrix proteins that copurified with gp120.
28814519|ab|7|28814519||RESULTS|RESULTS|CHO cell fibronectins were able to mediate the binding of a diverse panel of gp120 proteins to alpha4beta7 in an in vitro cell binding assay.
28814519|ab|8|28814519||RESULTS|RESULTS|The V2 loop was not required for fibronectin-mediated binding of gp120 to alpha4beta7, nor did V2-specific antibodies block this interaction.
28814519|ab|9|28814519||RESULTS|RESULTS|Removal of fibronectin through anion-exchange chromatography abrogated V2-independent gp120-alpha4beta7 binding.
28814519|ab|10|28814519||RESULTS|RESULTS|Additionally, we showed a recombinant human fibronectin fragment mediated gp120-alpha4beta7 interactions similarly to CHO cell fibronectin.
28814519|ab|11|28814519||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings provide an explanation for the apparently contradictory observations regarding the gp120-alpha4beta7 interaction and offer new insights into the potential role of fibronectin and other extracellular matrix proteins in HIV-1 biology.
28814519|ab|12|28814519||CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|IMPORTANCE Immune tissues within the gut are severely damaged by HIV-1, and this plays an important role in the development of AIDS.
28814519|ab|13|28814519||CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|Integrin alpha4beta7 plays a major role in the trafficking of lymphocytes, including CD4(+) T cells, into gut lymphoid tissues.
28814519|ab|14|28814519||CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|Previous reports indicate that some HIV-1 gp120 envelope proteins bind to and signal through alpha4beta7, which may help explain the preferential infection of gut CD4(+) T cells.
28814519|ab|15|28814519||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|In this study, we demonstrate that extracellular matrix proteins can mediate interactions between gp120 and alpha4beta7
28814519|ab|16|28814519||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This suggests that the extracellular matrix may be an important mediator of HIV-1 interaction with alpha4beta7-expressing cells.
28814519|ab|17|28814519||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings provide new insight into the nature of HIV-1-alpha4beta7 interactions and how these interactions may represent targets for therapeutic intervention.
28389154|ab|1|28389154||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Hitherto this is the first report pertaining to production of biofilm inhibitory compound(s) (BIC) from Bacillus subtilis BR4 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) coupled with production optimization.
28389154|ab|2|28389154||BACKGROUND|METHODS|In order to achieve this, combinations of media components were formulated by employing statistical tools such as Plackett-Burman analysis and central composite rotatable design (CCRD).
28389154|ab|3|28389154||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|It was evident that at 35mlL-1 glycerol and 3.8gL-1 casamino acid, anti-biofilm activity and production of extracellular protein significantly increased by 1.5-fold and 1.2-fold, respectively.
28389154|ab|4|28389154||RESULTS|RESULTS|These results corroborate that the combination of glycerol and casamino acid plays a key role in the production of BIC.
28389154|ab|5|28389154||METHODS|METHODS|Further, metabolic profiling of BIC was carried out using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based on m/z value.
28389154|ab|6|28389154||RESULTS|METHODS|The presence of Stigmatellin Y was predicted with monoisotopic neutral mass of 484.2825Da.
28389154|ab|7|28389154||RESULTS|RESULTS|In support of optimization study, higher production of BIC was confirmed in the optimized-media-grown BR4 (OPT-BR4) than in the ideal-media-grown BR4 (ID-BR4) by LC-MS/MS analysis.
28389154|ab|8|28389154||RESULTS|RESULTS|PqsR in P. aeruginosa is a potential target for anti-virulent therapy.
28389154|ab|9|28389154||RESULTS|RESULTS|Molecular docking study has revealed that Stigmatellin Y interacts with PqsR in the similar orientation like a cognate signal (PQS) and synthetic inhibitor.
28389154|ab|10|28389154||RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, Stigmatellin Y was found to exhibit interaction with four more amino acid residues of PqsR to establish strong affinity.
28389154|ab|11|28389154||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Stigmatellin Y thus might play a role of competitor for PQS to distract PQS-PqsR mediated communication in P. aeruginosa.
28389154|ab|12|28389154||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The present investigation thus paves new avenues to develop anti-Pseudomonas virulent therapy.
29857080|ab|1|29857080|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Perchloroethylene (perc) induced target organ toxicity has been associated with tissue-specific metabolic pathways.
29857080|ab|2|29857080|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Previous physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of perc accurately predicted oxidative metabolites but suggested the need to better characterize glutathione (GSH) conjugation as well as toxicokinetic uncertainty and variability.
29857080|ab|3|29857080|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We updated the previously published "harmonized" perc PBPK model in mice to better characterize GSH conjugation metabolism as well as the uncertainty and variability of perc toxicokinetics.
29857080|ab|4|29857080|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The updated PBPK model includes expanded models for perc and its oxidative metabolite trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and physiologically-based sub-models for conjugative metabolites.
29857080|ab|5|29857080|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Previously compiled mouse kinetic data in B6C3F1 and Swiss-Webster mice were augmented to include data from a recent study in male C57BL/6J mice that measured perc and metabolites in serum and multiple tissues.
29857080|ab|6|29857080|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Hierarchical Bayesian population analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo was conducted to characterize uncertainty and inter-strain variability in perc metabolism.
29857080|ab|7|29857080|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The updated model fit the data as well or better than the previously published "harmonized" PBPK model.
29857080|ab|8|29857080|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Tissue dosimetry for both oxidative and conjugative metabolites was successfully predicted across the three strains of mice, with estimated residuals errors of 2-fold for majority of data.
29857080|ab|9|29857080|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Inter-strain variability across three strains was evident for oxidative metabolism; GSH conjugation data were only available for one strain.
29857080|ab|10|29857080|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This updated PBPK model fills a critical data gap in quantitative risk assessment by predicting the internal dosimetry of perc and its oxidative and GSH conjugation metabolites and lays the groundwork for future studies to better characterize toxicokinetic variability.

29773463|ab|2|29773463|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Alarm intervention has been well known for more than 30 years.
29773463|ab|3|29773463|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|This method is a reliable and safe means of treating primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, being effective in 60-80% of cases.
29773463|ab|4|29773463|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of alarm intervention prolongation after the cure in order to reduce the risk of disease recurrence.
29773463|ab|5|29773463|STUDY DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|Two hundred ninety-four boys and 161 girls (455 persons in total) of age 9-14 years (average 11.4 years) took part in the prospective randomized study.
29773463|ab|6|29773463|STUDY DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|After preselection and establishing diagnosis, all patients were randomly divided in three groups.

29807157|ab|2|29807157|CONTEXT|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Multiple questionnaires are often administered resulting in overlapping questions increasing patient burden.
29807157|ab|3|29807157|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To examine the correlations between the commonly used European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30) and the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) on six coinciding items to determine consistency between overlapping items.
29807157|ab|4|29807157|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Data were prospectively collected from patients attending two cancer centers in the U.K.
29807157|ab|5|29807157|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Participants completed the QLQ-C30 version 3.0 every four weeks and the PRO-CTCAE at least once a week for 12 weeks.

29807157|ab|8|29807157|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Consistency and reliability was determined with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha.
29807157|ab|9|29807157|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|About 247 patients completed 785 QLQ-C30 and 2501 PRO-CTCAE questionnaires.
29807157|ab|10|29807157|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Moderate (ICC >0.5) to good (ICC >0.75) reliability and Cronbach's alpha >0.7 were found on all coinciding questions except for questions concerning the severity of nausea and vomiting as a result of relatively few patients responding to these questions.
29807157|ab|11|29807157|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Items on frequency showed better correlations than the severity and interference items.

29807878|ab|1|29807878|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Each year, many young Australians aged between 16 and 25 years experience a mental health disorder, yet only a small proportion access services and even fewer receive timely and evidence-based treatments.
29807878|ab|2|29807878|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Today, with ever-increasing access to the Internet and use of technology, the potential to provide all young people with access (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) to the support they require to improve their mental health and well-being is promising.
29807878|ab|3|29807878|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to use participatory design (PD) as research methodologies with end users (young people aged between 16 and 25 years and youth health professionals) and our research team to develop the Mental Health eClinic (a Web-based mental health clinic) to improve timely access to, and better quality, mental health care for young people across Australia.
29807878|ab|4|29807878|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A research and development (R&D) cycle for the codesign and build of the Mental Health eClinic included several iterative PD phases: PD workshops; translation of knowledge and ideas generated during workshops to produce mockups of webpages either as hand-drawn sketches or as wireframes (simple layout of a webpage before visual design and content is added); rapid prototyping; and one-on-one consultations with end users to assess the usability of the alpha build of the Mental Health eClinic.
29807878|ab|5|29807878|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Four PD workshops were held with 28 end users (young people n=18, youth health professionals n=10) and our research team (n=8).
29807878|ab|6|29807878|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Each PD workshop was followed by a knowledge translation session.
29807878|ab|7|29807878|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|At the conclusion of this cycle, the alpha prototype was built, and one round of one-on-one end user consultation sessions was conducted (n=6; all new participants, young people n=4, youth health professionals n=2).
29807878|ab|8|29807878|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The R&D cycle revealed the importance of five key components for the Mental Health eClinic: a home page with a visible triage system for those requiring urgent help; a comprehensive online physical and mental health assessment; a detailed dashboard of results; a booking and videoconferencing system to enable video visits; and the generation of a personalized well-being plan that includes links to evidence-based, and health professional-recommended, apps and etools.
29807878|ab|9|29807878|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The Mental Health eClinic provides health promotion, triage protocols, screening, assessment, a video visit system, the development of personalized well-being plans, and self-directed mental health support for young people.
29807878|ab|10|29807878|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|It presents a technologically advanced and clinically efficient system that can be adapted to suit a variety of settings in which there is an opportunity to connect with young people.
29807878|ab|11|29807878|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This will enable all young people, and especially those currently not able or willing to connect with face-to-face services, to receive best practice clinical services by breaking down traditional barriers to care and making health care more personalized, accessible, affordable, and available.
29952792|ab|1|29952792|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To synthesize published literature on noncommunicable disease (NCD) behavior change communication (BCC) interventions in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) and in the general population to inform efforts to adopt similar HIV and NCD BCC intervention activities.
29952792|ab|2|29952792|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We conducted a literature review of NCD BCC interventions and included 20 SSA-based studies.
29952792|ab|3|29952792|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Inclusion criteria entailed describing a BCC intervention targeting any four priority NCDs (cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cervical cancer, and depression) or both HIV and any of the NCDs.
29952792|ab|4|29952792|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework was used to assess potential public health impact of these studies.
29952792|ab|5|29952792|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We also solicited expert opinions from 10 key informants on the topic of HIV/NCD health promotion in five SSA countries.
29952792|ab|6|29952792|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The BCC interventions reviewed targeted multiple parts of the HIV and NCD continuum at both individual and community levels.
29952792|ab|7|29952792|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Various strategies (i.e. health education, social marketing, motivational interviewing, mobile health, and peer support) were employed.
29952792|ab|8|29952792|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, few studies addressed more than one dimension of the RE-AIM framework.
29952792|ab|9|29952792|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Opinions solicited from the key informants supported the feasibility of integrating HIV and NCD BCC interventions in SSA potentially improving access, service provision and service demand, especially for marginalized and vulnerable populations.
29952792|ab|10|29952792|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Although HIV/NCD integration can improve effectiveness of preventive services at individual and community levels, potential public health impact of such approaches remain unknown as reach, adoptability, and sustainability of both integrated and nonintegrated NCD BCC approaches published to date have not been well characterized.
27773891|ab|1|27773891||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The rhizome of Dioscorea bulbifera Linn, traditionally used to treat thyroid disease and cancer in China, is reported to induce serious liver injury during clinical practice.
27773891|ab|2|27773891||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Diosbulbin B (DB), a diterpene lactone, has been found to be the main toxic compound in D. bulbifera.
27773891|ab|3|27773891||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The present study aims to investigate the protection of ferulic acid (FA) against DB-induced acute liver injury and its engaged mechanism.
27773891|ab|4|27773891||METHODS|METHODS|Mice were orally administered FA (20, 40, 80 mg/kg) once daily for 6 consecutive days; and then orally given DB (250 mg/kg) on the last day.
27773891|ab|5|27773891||METHODS|METHODS|Daily FA (40, 80 mg/kg) decreased DB (250 mg/kg)-induced increase in serum levels of alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
27773891|ab|6|27773891||RESULTS|RESULTS|Histological evaluation showed that FA (80 mg/kg) ameliorated DB-induced hepatocellular degeneration and lymphocyte infiltration.
27773891|ab|7|27773891||RESULTS|RESULTS|Results of terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining assay showed that FA (80 mg/kg) decreased the DB-increased number of apoptotic hepatocytes.
27773891|ab|8|27773891||RESULTS|RESULTS|FA (40, 80 mg/kg) reduced DB-increased liver malondialdehyde (MDA) amount.
27773891|ab|9|27773891||RESULTS|RESULTS|FA (40, 80 mg/kg) decreased DB-increased serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and liver myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity.
27773891|ab|10|27773891||RESULTS|RESULTS|FA (80 mg/kg) reversed the DB-induced decrease in expression of inhibitor of kappa B (IkappaB) and the increase in nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaBp65).
27773891|ab|11|27773891||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Taken together, our results demonstrate that FA prevents DB-induced acute liver injury via inhibiting intrahepatic inflammation and liver apoptosis.

27146336|ab|2|27146336||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|The phase of the synthesized samples calcinated at 800 degrees C is isostructural with Bi4 Si3 O12 according to X-ray diffraction results.
27146336|ab|3|27146336||METHODS|RESULTS|Under excitation with 405 nm light, some typical peaks of Sm3+ ions centered at 566, 609, 655 and 715 nm are found in the emission spectra of the Sm3+ -doped Bi4 Si3 O12 phosphors.
27146336|ab|4|27146336||RESULTS|RESULTS|The strongest peak located at 609 nm is due to 4 G5/2 -6 H7/2 transition of Sm3+ . The luminescence intensity reaches its maximum value when the Sm3+ ion content is 4 mol%.

28887948|ab|1|28887948||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Psoriasis is caused by a complex interplay between the immune system, psoriasis-associated susceptibility loci, autoantigens, and multiple environmental factors.
28887948|ab|2|28887948||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Over the last 2 decades, research has unequivocally shown that psoriasis represents a bona fide T cell-mediated disease primarily driven by pathogenic T cells that produce high levels of IL-17 in response to IL-23.
28887948|ab|3|28887948||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The discovery of the central role for the IL-23/type 17 T-cell axis in the development of psoriasis has led to a major paradigm shift in the pathogenic model for this condition.
28887948|ab|4|28887948||RESULTS|RESULTS|The activation and upregulation of IL-17 in prepsoriatic skin produces a "feed forward" inflammatory response in keratinocytes that is self-amplifying and drives the development of mature psoriatic plaques by inducing epidermal hyperplasia, epidermal cell proliferation, and recruitment of leukocyte subsets into the skin.
28887948|ab|5|28887948||RESULTS|RESULTS|Clinical trial data for mAbs against IL-17 signaling (secukinumab, ixekizumab, and brodalumab) and newer IL-23p19 antagonists (tildrakizumab, guselkumab, and risankizumab) underscore the central role of these cytokines as predominant drivers of psoriatic disease.
28887948|ab|6|28887948||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Currently, we are witnessing a translational revolution in the treatment and management of psoriasis.
28887948|ab|7|28887948||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Emerging bispecific antibodies offer the potential for even better disease control, whereas small-molecule drugs offer future alternatives to the use of biologics and less costly long-term disease management.

28617276|ab|1|28617276||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Water contamination with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) has become one of the key issues in recent years that threatens human health and ecological systems.
28617276|ab|2|28617276||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The present study is aimed at removing PTEs like cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) from aqueous solutions and industrial wastewater using activated carbon (AC) as an adsorbent through different batch and column experiments.
28617276|ab|3|28617276||METHODS|RESULTS|Results demonstrated that the removal of PTEs from aqueous solutions was highly pH dependent, except for Cr, and the maximum removal (>78%) was recorded at pH 6.0.
28617276|ab|4|28617276||RESULTS|RESULTS|However, maximum Cr removal (82.8%) was observed at pH 3.0.
28617276|ab|5|28617276||RESULTS|RESULTS|The adsorption reached equilibrium after 60 min with 2 g of adsorbent.
28617276|ab|6|28617276||RESULTS|RESULTS|Coefficient (R2) values suggested by the Langmuir isotherm model were 0.97, 0.96, 0.93 and 0.95 for Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb, respectively, indicating the fit to this model.
28617276|ab|7|28617276||RESULTS|RESULTS|In column experiments, the maximum removal of PTEs was observed at an adsorbent bed height of 20 cm with the optimal flow rate of 3.56 mL/min.
28617276|ab|8|28617276||RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, PTEs removal by AC was observed in the order of Cu > Cd > Pb > Cr.
28617276|ab|9|28617276||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Findings from this study suggest that AC could be used as a promising adsorbent for simultaneously removing several PTEs from wastewaters.
27440795|ab|1|27440795||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The circadian clock is thought to adjust retinal sensitivity to ambient light levels, yet the involvement of specific clock genes is poorly understood.
27440795|ab|2|27440795||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We explored the potential role of the nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (REV-ERBalpha; or NR1D1) in this respect.
27440795|ab|3|27440795||METHODS|RESULTS|In light-evoked behavioral tests, compared with wild-type littermates, Rev-Erbalpha-/- mice showed enhanced negative masking at low light levels (0.1 lx).
27440795|ab|4|27440795||RESULTS|RESULTS|Rev-Erbalpha-/- mouse retinas displayed significantly higher numbers of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs; 62% more compared with wild-type) and more intense melanopsin immunostaining of individual ipRGCs.
27440795|ab|5|27440795||RESULTS|RESULTS|In agreement with a pivotal role for melanopsin, negative masking at low light intensities was abolished in Rev-Erbalpha-/- Opn4-/- (melanopsin gene) double-null mice.
27440795|ab|6|27440795||RESULTS|RESULTS|Rev-Erbalpha-/- mice showed shortened latencies of both a and b electroretinogram waves, modified scotopic and photopic b-wave and scotopic threshold responses, and increased pupillary constriction, all of which suggested increased light sensitivity.
27440795|ab|7|27440795||RESULTS|RESULTS|However, wild-type and Rev-Erbalpha-/- mice displayed no detectable differences by in vivo fundus imaging, retinal histology, or expression of cell type-specific markers for major retinal cell populations.
27440795|ab|8|27440795||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We conclude that REV-ERBalpha plays a major role in retinal information processing, and we speculate that REV-ERBalpha and melanopsin set sensitivity levels of the rod-mediated ipRGC pathway to coordinate activity with ambient light.-Ait-Hmyed Hakkari, O., Acar, N., Savier, E., Spinnhirny, P., Bennis, M., Felder-Schmittbuhl, M.-P., Mendoza, J., Hicks, D.

29956827|ab|1|29956827|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Peginterferon induces off-treatment responses in approximately one-third of patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B.
29956827|ab|2|29956827|AIMS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to develop an easy-to-use baseline prediction score to identify hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype B-/C-infected HBeAg-positive Asian patients likely to respond to peginterferon alfa-2a.
29956827|ab|3|29956827|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Generalised additive models, multiple logistic regression (MLR) analysis and internal validation methods were applied to data from 647 HBeAg-positive patients from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to develop a scoring system to predict response 24 weeks after completing a 48-week course of peginterferon alfa-2a.
29956827|ab|4|29956827|RESULTS|RESULTS|METHODS|Five baseline factors (age, sex, alanine aminotransferase ratio, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level and HBV DNA level) were retained in the final MLR for HBeAg seroconversion and used to develop a scoring system from 0 to 7.
29956827|ab|5|29956827|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Among patients with scores of 0-1, 2-3, 4 or >/=5, HBeAg seroconversion was achieved in 6.4% (6/94), 23.0% (61/265), 36.4% (67/184) and 54.8% (57/104), respectively, and a combined response (HBeAg seroconversion plus HBV DNA <2000 IU/mL) in 5.3% (5/94), 12.8% (34/265), 25.0% (46/184) and 36.5% (38/104), respectively.

29806864|ab|1|29806864|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a newly defined geriatric syndrome that causes nutritional and respiratory complications in older hospitalized patients.
29806864|ab|2|29806864|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Following hospital discharge, OD also causes hospital readmission and mortality in this population.
29806864|ab|3|29806864|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Our aim was to assess the effect of a minimal-massive intervention (MMI) in reducing nutritional and respiratory complications in older hospitalized patients with OD.
29806864|ab|4|29806864|DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS|METHODS|METHODS|An open label trial was performed on 186 hospitalized older patients (>70y) with OD; 62 of these patients with OD were treated with the MMI and paired by sex, age, functionality, comorbidities and body mass index with two controls.
29806864|ab|5|29806864|INTERVENTION|METHODS|METHODS|The MMI consisted of: a) fluid thickening and texture-modified foods, b) caloric and protein supplementation; and c) oral health and hygiene recommendations during hospitalization and following discharge.
29806864|ab|6|29806864|INTERVENTION|METHODS|METHODS|The control group followed the standard clinical practice without MMI.
29806864|ab|7|29806864|MEASUREMENTS|METHODS|METHODS|Main study outcomes were hospital readmissions, respiratory infections, nutritional status and survival after 6 months follow up.
29806864|ab|8|29806864|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Both groups had similar advanced age (84.87+/-6.02MMI and 84.42+/-5.31 years), poor functionality (Barthel 59.51+/-26.76 MMI and 58.84+/-26.87), and high comorbidities (Charlson 3.00+/-1.60 MMI and 3.06+/-1.45).
29806864|ab|9|29806864|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Main results showed that MMI improved nutritional status (MNA 9.84+/-2.05 pre-MMI vs. 11.31+/-2.21 post-MMI; p=0.0038) and functionality (Barthel 62.34+/-25.43 pre-MMI vs. 73.44+/-25.19 post-MMI; p=0.007).
29806864|ab|10|29806864|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition MMI decreased hospital readmissions (68.8 readmissions/100 persons-year (28.1-109.38) MMI vs. 190.8 (156.0-225.7); p=0.001), respiratory infections (12.50 readmissions/100 persons-year (0-29.82) MMI vs. 74.68 (52.86-96.50); p=0.002), and increased 6-month survival (84.13% MMI vs. 70.96%; p=0.044).
29806864|ab|11|29806864|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our results suggest that a MMI in hospitalized older patients with OD improves nutritional status and functionality and reduces hospital readmissions, respiratory infections and mortality.
29806864|ab|12|29806864|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|MMI might become a new simple and cost-effective strategy to avoid OD complications in the geriatric population admitted with an acute disease to a general hospital.
29786159|ab|1|29786159|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Low and high birthweight is known to increase the risk of acute and longer-term adverse outcomes, such as stillbirth, infant mortality, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
29786159|ab|2|29786159|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Gestational dyslipidaemia is associated with a numbers of adverse birth outcomes, but evidence regarding birthweight is still inconsistent to reliably inform clinical practice and treatment recommendations.
29786159|ab|3|29786159|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal gestational dyslipidaemia and neonatal health outcomes, namely, birthweight, metabolic factors and inflammatory parameters.
29786159|ab|4|29786159|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We searched systematically Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL Plus and Cochrane Library up to 1 August 2016 (with an updated search in MEDLINE at the end of July 2017) for longitudinal studies that assessed the association of maternal lipid levels during pregnancy with neonatal birthweight, or metabolic and inflammatory parameters up to 3 years old.
29786159|ab|5|29786159|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Data from 46 publications including 31,402 pregnancies suggest that maternal high triglycerides and low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels throughout pregnancy are associated with increased birthweight, higher risk of large for gestational age and macrosomia and lower risk of small-for-gestational age.
29786159|ab|6|29786159|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The findings were consistent across the studied populations, but stronger associations were observed in women who were overweight or obese prior to pregnancy.

29778684|ab|1|29778684|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Psychosocial research has shown that perceived exposure can influence symptom reporting, regardless of actual exposure.
29778684|ab|2|29778684|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The impact of this phenomenon on the interpretation of results from epidemiological research on environmental determinants of symptoms is unclear.
29778684|ab|3|29778684|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Our aim was to compare associations between modeled exposures, the perceived level of these exposures and reported symptoms (non-specific symptoms, sleep disturbances, and respiratory symptoms) for three different environmental exposures (radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), noise, and air pollution).
29778684|ab|4|29778684|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|These environmental exposures vary in the degree to which they can be sensorially observed.
29778684|ab|5|29778684|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Participant characteristics, perceived exposures, and self-reported health were assessed with a baseline (n=14,829, 2011/2012) and follow-up (n=7905, 2015) questionnaire in the Dutch population-based Occupational and Environmental Health Cohort (AMIGO).
29778684|ab|6|29778684|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Environmental exposures were estimated at the home address using spatial models.
29778684|ab|7|29778684|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models were used to examine the associations between modeled and perceived exposures, and reported symptoms.
29778684|ab|8|29778684|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The extent to which exposure sources could be observed by participants likely influenced correlations between modeled and perceived exposure as correlations were moderate for air pollution (rSp=0.34) and noise (rSp=0.40), but less so for RF-EMF (rSp=0.11).
29778684|ab|9|29778684|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Perceived exposures were consistently associated with increased symptom scores (respiratory, sleep, non-specific).
29778684|ab|10|29778684|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Modeled exposures, except RF-EMF, were associated with increased symptom scores, but these associations disappeared or strongly diminished when accounted for perceived exposure in the analyses.
29778684|ab|11|29778684|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Perceived exposure has an important role in symptom reporting.
29778684|ab|12|29778684|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|When environmental determinants of symptoms are studied without acknowledging the potential role of both modeled and perceived exposures, there is a risk of bias in health risk assessment.
29778684|ab|13|29778684|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|However, the etiological role of exposure perceptions in relation to symptom reporting requires further research.

27183956|ab|2|27183956||METHODS|METHODS|We performed a search of the American College of Surgeons-NSQIP database for all patients undergoing an operation with a surgeon whose primary specialty was neurological surgery from 2006 to 2013.
27183956|ab|3|27183956||METHODS|METHODS|Analysis of patient demographics and pre-operative co-morbidities was performed, and multivariate analysis was used to determine predictors of surgical complications.
27183956|ab|4|27183956||RESULTS|RESULTS|From 2006 to 2013, the percentage of spinal operations performed by neurosurgeons relative to cranial and peripheral nerve cases increased from 68.0% to 76.8% (p<0.001) according to the NSQIP database.
27183956|ab|5|27183956||RESULTS|RESULTS|The proportion of cranial cases during the same time period decreased from 29.7% to 21.6% (p<0.001).
27183956|ab|6|27183956||RESULTS|RESULTS|The overall 30-day complication rate among all 94,621 NSQIP reported patients undergoing operations with a neurosurgeon over this time period was 8.2% (5.6% for spinal operations, 16.1% for cranial operations).
27183956|ab|7|27183956||RESULTS|RESULTS|The overall rate decreased from 11.0% in 2006 to 7.5% in 2013 (p<0.001).

29782314|ab|2|29782314|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We examined the clinical utility of MSmetrix and investigated if automated MRI volumes could discriminate between groups covering the AD continuum and could be used as a predictor for clinical progression.
29782314|ab|3|29782314|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The Belgian Dementia Council initiated a retrospective, multi-center study and analyzed whole brain (WB), grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cortical GM (CGM) volumes, and WM hyperintensities (WMH) using MSmetrix in the AD continuum.
29782314|ab|4|29782314|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Baseline (n = 887) and follow-up (FU, n = 95) T1-weighted brain MRIs and time-linked neuropsychological data were available.
29782314|ab|5|29782314|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The cohort consisted of cognitively healthy controls (HC, n = 93), subjective cognitive decline (n = 102), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 379), and AD dementia (n = 313).
29782314|ab|6|29782314|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Baseline WB and GM volumes could accurately discriminate between clinical diagnostic groups and were significantly decreased with increasing cognitive impairment.
29782314|ab|7|29782314|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|MCI patients had a significantly larger change in WB, GM, and CGM volumes based on two MRIs (n = 95) compared to HC (FU>24months, p = 0.020).
29782314|ab|8|29782314|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Linear regression models showed that baseline atrophy of WB, GM, CGM, and increased CSF volumes predicted cognitive impairment.
29782314|ab|9|29782314|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|WB and GM volumes extracted by MSmetrix could be used to define the clinical spectrum of AD accurately and along with CGM, they are able to predict cognitive impairment based on (decline in) MMSE scores.
29782314|ab|10|29782314|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Therefore, MSmetrix can support clinicians in their diagnostic decisions, is able to detect clinical disease progression, and is of help to stratify populations for clinical trials.

27871868|ab|1|27871868||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Skin sensitization is unique in the world of toxicology.
27871868|ab|2|27871868||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|There is a combination of reliable, validated predictive test methods for identification of skin sensitizing chemicals, a clearly documented and transparent approach to risk assessment, and effective feedback from dermatology clinics around the world delivering evidence of the success or failure of the hazard identification/risk assessment/management process.
27871868|ab|3|27871868||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Recent epidemics of contact allergy, particularly to preservatives, have raised questions of whether the safety/risk assessment process is working in an optimal manner (or indeed is working at all!).
27871868|ab|4|27871868||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This review has as its focus skin sensitization quantitative risk assessment (QRA).
27871868|ab|5|27871868||METHODS|METHODS|The core toxicological principles of QRA are reviewed, and evidence of use and misuse examined.
27871868|ab|6|27871868||RESULTS|RESULTS|What becomes clear is that skin sensitization QRA will only function adequately if two essential criteria are met.
27871868|ab|7|27871868||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The first is that QRA is applied rigourously, and the second is that potential exposure to the sensitizing substance is assessed adequately.
27871868|ab|8|27871868||RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|This conclusion will come as no surprise to any toxicologist who appreciates the basic premise that "risk = hazard x exposure".
27871868|ab|9|27871868||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Accordingly, use of skin sensitization QRA is encouraged, not least because the essential feedback from dermatology clinics can be used as a tool to refine QRA in situations where this risk assessment tool has not been properly used.

28832656|ab|1|28832656||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Age-related dementia is one of the most devastating disorders affecting the elderly.
28832656|ab|2|28832656||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Recently, emerging data suggest that impaired insulin signaling is the major contributor in the development of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), which is the most common type of senile dementia.
28832656|ab|3|28832656||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In the present study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of metformin (Met) and saxagliptin (Saxa), as insulin sensitizing agents, in a rat model of brain aging and AD using D-galactose (D-gal, 150 mg/kg/day, s.c. for 90 successive days).
28832656|ab|4|28832656||METHODS|METHODS|Six groups of adult male Wistar rats were used: normal, D-gal, Met (500 mg/kg/day, p.o), and Saxa (1 mg/kg/day, p.o) control groups, as well as D-gal/Met and D-gal/Sax treated groups.
28832656|ab|5|28832656||METHODS|METHODS|Impaired learning and memory function was observed in rats treated with D-gal using Morris water maze test.
28832656|ab|6|28832656||RESULTS|RESULTS|Biochemical and histopathological findings also revealed some characteristic changes of AD in the brain that include the increased content of acetylcholine, glutamate, and phosphorelated tau, as well as deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
28832656|ab|7|28832656||RESULTS|RESULTS|Induction of insulin resistance in experimentally aged rats was evidenced by increased blood glycated hemoglobin, brain contents of insulin and receptors for advanced glycated end-products, as well as decreased brain insulin receptor level.
28832656|ab|8|28832656||RESULTS|RESULTS|Elevation of oxidative stress markers and TNF-alpha brain content was also demonstrated.
28832656|ab|9|28832656||RESULTS|RESULTS|Met and Saxa, with a preference to Met, restored the normal memory and learning functions in rats, improved D-gal-induced state of insulin resistance, oxidative stress and inflammation, and ameliorated the AD biochemical and histopathological alterations in brain tissues.
28832656|ab|10|28832656||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our findings suggest that D-gal model of aging results in a diminishing of learning and memory function by producing a state of impaired insulin signaling that causes a cascade of deleterious events like oxidative stress, inflammation, and tau hyper-phosphorylation.
28832656|ab|11|28832656||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Reversing of these harmful effects by the use of insulin-sensitizing drugs like Met and Saxa suggests their involvement in alleviation insulin resistance as the underlying pathology of AD and hence their potential use as anti-dementia drugs.

27773671|ab|3|27773671||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|MOZ (KAT6A) is a lysine acetyltransferase and enhances transcription at target gene loci.
27773671|ab|4|27773671||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In contrast, the Polycomb group protein BMI1 (PCGF4) is part of the transcriptionally repressive PRC1 complex.
27773671|ab|5|27773671||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Despite their opposing effects on transcription, MOZ and BMI1 regulate biological systems in a similar manner.
27773671|ab|6|27773671||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|MOZ and BMI1 are required for the development of transplantable HSCs, for restraining cellular senescence, for the proper patterning of the anterior-posterior axis during development and for the specification and maintenance of the B-cell lineage.

29848284|ab|1|29848284|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an over accumulation of triglyceride in the liver without alcohol consumption which its major cause is from insulin resistance.
29848284|ab|2|29848284|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Patients with NAFLD can develop to be liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
29848284|ab|3|29848284|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene silencing.
29848284|ab|4|29848284|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Previous research reported that miR-29 family (a, b and c) and miR-122 have an important role in regulating insulin resistance related to NAFLD.
29848284|ab|5|29848284|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The purpose of this study was to investigate that miR-29 and miR-122 can be possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD.
29848284|ab|6|29848284|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|Serum samples were collected from 58 NAFLD patients and 34 healthy controls.
29848284|ab|7|29848284|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|MiRNAs were extracted from serum by using microRNA purification kit followed by polyuridylation, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR.
29848284|ab|8|29848284|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|Also, we analyzed the correlation between miR-29 and miR-122 and level of liver inflammation in NAFLD patients.
29848284|ab|9|29848284|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We found that the serum miR-29a levels in NAFLD patients were significantly lower (P = 0.006) than the control group, while miR-29c levels were unchanged, and miR-29b levels were undetectable.
29848284|ab|10|29848284|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, we found that serum miR-122 levels in NAFLD patients were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those found in the control group.
29848284|ab|11|29848284|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|For miR-29a, the area under curve (AUC) was 0.679 (P = 0.0065) with 60.87% sensitivity and 82.35% specificity.
29848284|ab|12|29848284|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|For miR-122, the AUC was 0.831 (P < 0.0001) with 75.00% sensitivity and 82.35% specificity.
29848284|ab|13|29848284|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Interestingly, the level of serum miR-122 were significantly different between patients with not steatohepatitis (NAS < 4) and steatohepatitis (NAS >/= 4), indicating that the levels of miR-122 were related to the severity of NAFLD.
29848284|ab|14|29848284|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The levels of miR-29a and miR-122 might be beneficial and compelling as possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD.
27486950|ab|1|27486950||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Mercury is a toxic heavy metal and presents significant threats to organisms and natural ecosystems.
27486950|ab|2|27486950||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Recently, the mercury remediation as well as its detection by environmental-friendly biotechnology has received increasing attention.
27486950|ab|3|27486950||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|In this study, carboxylesterase E2 from mercury-resistant strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA1 has been successfully displayed on the outer membrane of Escherichia coli Top10 bacteria to simultaneously adsorb and detect mercury ion (Hg(2+)).
27486950|ab|4|27486950||RESULTS|RESULTS|The transmission electron microscopy analysis shows that Hg(2+) can be absorbed by carboxylesterase E2 and accumulated on the outer membrane of surface-displayed E. coli bacteria.
27486950|ab|5|27486950||RESULTS|RESULTS|The adsorption of Hg(2+) followed a physicochemical, equilibrated and saturatable mechanism, which well fits the traditional Langmuir adsorption model.
27486950|ab|6|27486950||RESULTS|RESULTS|The surface-displayed system can be regenerated through regulating pH values.
27486950|ab|7|27486950||RESULTS|RESULTS|As its activity can be inhibited by Hg(2+), carboxylesterase E2 has been used to detect the concentration of Hg(2+) in water samples.
27486950|ab|8|27486950||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The developed surface display system will be of great potential in the simultaneous bioremediation and biodetection of environmental mercury pollution.

28423016|ab|1|28423016||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Evaluating physical discomfort of designed gestures is important for creating safe and usable gesture-based interaction systems; yet, gestural discomfort evaluation has not been extensively studied in HCI, and few evaluation methods seem currently available whose utility has been experimentally confirmed.
28423016|ab|2|28423016||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To address this, this study empirically demonstrated the utility of the subjective rating method after a small number of gesture repetitions (a maximum of four repetitions) in evaluating designed gestures in terms of physical discomfort resulting from prolonged, repetitive gesture use.
28423016|ab|3|28423016||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The subjective rating method has been widely used in previous gesture studies but without empirical evidence on its utility.
28423016|ab|4|28423016||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study also proposed a gesture discomfort evaluation method based on an existing ergonomics posture evaluation tool (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) and demonstrated its utility in evaluating designed gestures in terms of physical discomfort resulting from prolonged, repetitive gesture use.
28423016|ab|5|28423016||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Rapid Upper Limb Assessment is an ergonomics postural analysis tool that quantifies the work-related musculoskeletal disorders risks for manual tasks, and has been hypothesized to be capable of correctly determining discomfort resulting from prolonged, repetitive gesture use.
28423016|ab|6|28423016||METHODS|METHODS|The two methods were evaluated through comparisons against a baseline method involving discomfort rating after actual prolonged, repetitive gesture use.
28423016|ab|7|28423016||RESULTS|RESULTS|Correlation analyses indicated that both methods were in good agreement with the baseline.
28423016|ab|8|28423016||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The methods proposed in this study seem useful for predicting discomfort resulting from prolonged, repetitive gesture use, and are expected to help interaction designers create safe and usable gesture-based interaction systems.
28013141|ab|1|28013141||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|A novel eco-engineered mixed anaerobic culture was successfully demonstrated for the first time to be capable of continuous regeneration in nutrient limiting conditions.
28013141|ab|2|28013141||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Microbial catabolism has been found to support a closed system of nutrients able to enrich a culture of lithotrophic methanogens and provide microbial cell recycling.
28013141|ab|3|28013141||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|After enrichment, the hydrogenotrophic species was the dominating methanogens while a bacterial substratum was responsible for the redistribution of nutrients. 
28013141|ab|4|28013141||RESULTS|RESULTS|q-PCR results indicated that 7% of the total population was responsible for the direct conversion of the gases.
28013141|ab|5|28013141||RESULTS|RESULTS|The efficiency of H2/CO2 conversion to CH4 reached 100% at a gassing rate of above 60v/v/d.
28013141|ab|6|28013141||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The pH of the culture media was effectively sustained at optimal levels (pH 7-8) through a buffering system created by the dissolved CO2.
28013141|ab|7|28013141||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|The novel approach can reduce the process nutrient/metal requirement and enhance the environmental and financial performance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for renewable energy storage.

29957545|ab|1|29957545|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Dolutegravir (DTG) is a next-generation HIV integrase inhibitor (INI) with an increased genetic barrier to resistance with respect to raltegravir (RAL) or elvitegravir (EVG).
29957545|ab|2|29957545|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Few data are available on the durability of DTG-containing regimens.
29957545|ab|3|29957545|OBJECTIVES|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|We aimed at investigating the duration of the DTG-containing regimen, the occurrence of an HIV-1 RNA blip, and factors associated with DTG virological response.
29957545|ab|4|29957545|STUDY DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|From the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis database, we selected 89 HIV-1-positive four-class-experienced subjects who started DTG after receiving RAL or EVG.
29957545|ab|5|29957545|STUDY DESIGN|RESULTS|METHODS|Factors associated with durability and virological response were analysed by logistic regression.
29957545|ab|6|29957545|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|After a median duration of 18.8 [0.4-76.2] months, 79/89 (88.8%) subjects were still on DTG.
29957545|ab|7|29957545|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|All subjects remaining on DTG at the end of follow-up had undetectable HIV-1 RNA, compared to 5/10 subjects who discontinued DTG.
29957545|ab|8|29957545|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|DTG discontinuation was less frequent in patients who had experienced >/=10 regimens (HR 0.11, p=0.040).
29957545|ab|9|29957545|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The probability of having an HIV-1 RNA positive value at the last follow-up significantly increased in patients with non-B HIV-1 subtype (HR 5.77, p<.001) and significantly decreased in patients with CD4 nadir >200/muL (HR 0.29, p=0.038), with more than 10 previous regimens (HR 0.27, p=0.040), and who harbored virus with IN mutations (HR 0.12, p=0.023) at DTG start.
29957545|ab|10|29957545|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|After previous exposure to first-generation INIs, treatment with DTG showed long durability and did not show virological rebound after virological suppression.
29957545|ab|11|29957545|CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|CONCLUSIONS|Subjects infected with a non-B HIV-1 subtype had a greater risk of having detectable HIV-1 RNA at the last observation.
27614034|ab|1|27614034||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|The enantioselective environmental behaviors of the chiral insecticide fipronil and its metabolites in lab-scale aquatic ecosystems were studied and the toxicity of fipronil enantiomers and the metabolites to non-target organisms Lemna minor (L. minor) and Anodonta woodiana (A. woodiana) was also investigated in this work.
27614034|ab|2|27614034||RESULTS|METHODS|Water-sediment, water-L. minor, water-A. woodiana, and water-sediment-L. minor-A. woodiana ecosystems were set up and exposed to fipronil through a 90-day period.
27614034|ab|3|27614034||RESULTS|RESULTS|The results showed fipronil could be degraded significantly faster (half-life of 4.6 days) in the complex water-sediment-L. minor-A. woodiana ecosystem.
27614034|ab|4|27614034||RESULTS|RESULTS|A. woodiana played a crucial role in the dissipation of fipronil, and the microorganisms in the sediment also made great contribution to the degradation of fipronil in aquatic ecosystems.
27614034|ab|5|27614034||RESULTS|RESULTS|All the three metabolites fipronil desulfinyl, fipronil sulfide and fipronil sulfone were detected in the ecosystems and were more persistent than fipronil.
27614034|ab|6|27614034||RESULTS|RESULTS|Enantioselective degradation of fipronil was observed with S-fipronil being preferentially degraded in sediment and L. minor, while R-fipronil was metabolized preferentially in A. woodiana.
27614034|ab|7|27614034||RESULTS|RESULTS|EC50 for L. minor was obtained using 7-day exposure, and for A. woodiana was obtained using 72-h exposure.
27614034|ab|8|27614034||RESULTS|RESULTS|S-fipronil was more toxic to A. woodiana, while R-fipronil showed higher toxicity to L. minor.
27614034|ab|9|27614034||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Moreover, the three metabolites were found more toxic than fipronil indicating significant environment risks due to their persistence.
27614034|ab|10|27614034||OBJECTIVE|CONCLUSIONS|The present study might have important implications for the risk assessment of fipronil and its metabolites in real aquatic environment.

29953967|ab|5|29953967|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Sensitivity analysis, publication bias and meta-regression were conducted by Stata 14.0.
29953967|ab|6|29953967|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In total, 34 observational studies, 8 prospective cohort studies and 4 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were enrolled in the present analysis.
29953967|ab|7|29953967|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|It was demonstrated that statin usage improved all-cause mortality in lower limb, carotid, aortic and mixed types of vascular surgery subgroups compared with those in which statins were not used.
29953967|ab|8|29953967|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Additionally, the employment of statins efficiently enhanced the primary and secondary patency rates and significantly decreased the amputation rates in the lower limb revascularization subgroup.
29953967|ab|9|29953967|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, for other complications, statin intervention decreased cardiovascular events in mixed types of vascular surgeries and stroke incidence in the carotid surgery subgroup.
29953967|ab|10|29953967|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|No significant publication bias was observed.
29953967|ab|11|29953967|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The meta-regression results showed that the morbidity of cardiovascular disease or the use of aspirin might affect the overall estimates in several subgroups.
29953967|ab|12|29953967|CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|CONCLUSIONS|This meta-analysis demonstrated that statin therapy was associated with improved survival rates and patency rates and with reduced cardiovascular or stroke morbidities in patients who underwent non-cardiac vascular surgeries.

29953586|ab|3|29953586|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We retrospectively included a consecutive cohort of surgical patients who had a negative preoperative MRI by radiology report.
29953586|ab|4|29953586|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|MAP was performed on T1-weighted volumetric sequence and QPET was performed on PET/computed tomographic data, both with comparison to scanner-specific normal databases.
29953586|ab|5|29953586|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Concordance between MAP and QPET was assessed at a lobar level, and the significance of concordant QPET-MAP(+) abnormalities was confirmed by postresective seizure outcome and histopathology.
29953586|ab|6|29953586|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|QPET thresholds of standard deviations (SDs) of -1, -2, -3, and -4 were evaluated to identify the optimal threshold for QPET-MAP analysis.
29953586|ab|7|29953586|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A total of 104 patients were included.
29953586|ab|8|29953586|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|When QPET thresholds of SD = -1, -2, and -3 were used, complete resection of the QPET-MAP(+) region was significantly associated with seizure-free outcome when compared with the partial resection group (P = 0.023, P < 0.001, P = 0.006) or the no resection group (P = 0.002, P < 0.001, P = 0.001).
29953586|ab|9|29953586|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The SD threshold of -2 showed the best combination of positive rate (55%), sensitivity (0.68), specificity (0.88), positive predictive value (0.88), and negative predictive value (0.69).

29790981|ab|1|29790981|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Aging of the population has prompted an escalation of service utilization and costs in many jurisdictions including North America.
29790981|ab|2|29790981|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|However, relatively little is known on the economic impact of old age on the management of acute spine trauma (AST).
29790981|ab|3|29790981|OBJECTIVE|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|To examine the potential effects of age on the service utilization and costs of the management of patients with acute spine trauma.
29790981|ab|4|29790981|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients with AST admitted to an acute spine care unit of a Canadian quaternary university hospital between February, 2002 and September, 2007.
29790981|ab|5|29790981|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The study population was grouped into elderly (>/=65 yr) and younger individuals.

29956879|ab|1|29956879|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Impulse control behaviors (ICBs) are impulsive-compulsive behaviors often associated with dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD).
29956879|ab|2|29956879|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although remission can occur in ICB, only four reports on the ratio of remission and the persistence of ICB have been published, and the associated factors with ICB remission or persistence have been little known.
29956879|ab|3|29956879|INTRODUCTION|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal assessment of the remission, persistence, and development of ICB and those associated factors in patients with PD.
29956879|ab|4|29956879|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We retrospectively investigated a PD database at Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Japan.
29956879|ab|5|29956879|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|One hundred and forty-eight patients with PD who could be followed up for 2 years were enrolled.
29956879|ab|6|29956879|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|ICB was assessed using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease.
29956879|ab|7|29956879|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Motor severity (Hoehn and Yahr scale and United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination), and other clinical variables (sex, age, onset age, disease duration, olfactory dysfunction, and dyskinesia) and medications used to treat PD were assessed.
29956879|ab|8|29956879|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Univariate analyses were performed.
29956879|ab|9|29956879|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Seven patients were excluded because of the exclusion criteria, and 141 patients were analyzed.
29956879|ab|10|29956879|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Thirty patients (21.3%) had ICB at baseline, and these patients also had significantly higher use of pergolide.
29956879|ab|11|29956879|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The ICB remission rate was 60%, the ICB persistence ratio was 40%, and the ICB development ratio was 12.6% over 2 years.
29956879|ab|12|29956879|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Statistically, younger age and pergolide use were associated with ICB persistence.
29956879|ab|13|29956879|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Being male, having dyskinesia, and rotigotine, entacapone, zonisamide, and istradefylline use were associated with ICB development.
29956879|ab|14|29956879|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This study suggests that younger age and pergolide use may be the new associated factors with ICB persistence and that entacapone, zonisamide, and istradefylline use may be associated with the development of ICB.

28235656|ab|1|28235656||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|The aberrant expression or mutation of CFTR has been shown to be involved in several tumors, but how mutations or dysfunction of CFTR may increase the risk of malignancies in various tissues remains unclear.
28235656|ab|2|28235656||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Here, we report the interaction between CFTR and HDAC2, and its involvement in the development of Ph+ leukemia.
28235656|ab|3|28235656||RESULTS|RESULTS|We first detected the physical interaction and co-localization of CFTR and HDAC2 in Ph+ leukemia cell lines.
28235656|ab|4|28235656||RESULTS|RESULTS|And treatment with CFTRinh-172, a CFTR inhibitor, reduced the expression of HDAC2 protein in K562 and SUP-B15 cells, which could be partially recovered by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor.
28235656|ab|5|28235656||RESULTS|RESULTS|Additionally, high expression levels of HDAC2 protein were observed in CFTR cDNA transfected HEK-293 and Ba/F3 cells.
28235656|ab|6|28235656||RESULTS|RESULTS|Next, we found that HDAC2 bound in the promoter region of the PTEN gene, and treatment with HDAC2 inhibitor or CFTRinh-172 resulted in an increase in PTEN mRNA and protein levels and a decrease in PDK1 and mTOR (downstream signaling of PTEN) activity.
28235656|ab|7|28235656||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Finally, the MTT assay revealed that CFTRinh-172 could strengthen the anti-proliferation effect of HDAC2 inhibitor on Ph+ leukemia cells.
28235656|ab|8|28235656||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Altogether, this study provides strong evidence that high-expression CFTR plays an important role in the development of Ph+ leukemia through the HDAC2-mediated PTEN pathway.
29954325|ab|1|29954325|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Radiation exposure due to the detonation of an improvised nuclear device remains a major security concern.
29954325|ab|2|29954325|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Radiation from such a device involves a combination of photons and neutrons.
29954325|ab|3|29954325|BACKGROUND|RESULTS|BACKGROUND|Although photons will make the greater contribution to the total dose, neutrons will certainly have an impact on the severity of the exposure as they have high relative biological effectiveness.
29954325|ab|4|29954325|RESULTS|RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|We investigated the gene expression signatures in the blood of mice exposed to 3 Gy x-rays, 0.75 Gy of neutrons, or to mixed field photon/neutron with the neutron fraction contributing 5, 15%, or 25% of a total 3 Gy radiation dose.
29954325|ab|5|29954325|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in protein ubiquitination pathways were significantly overrepresented in all radiation doses and qualities.
29954325|ab|6|29954325|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|On the other hand, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2) signaling pathway was identified as one of the top 10 ranked canonical pathways in neutron, but not pure x-ray, exposures.
29954325|ab|7|29954325|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, the related mTOR and regulation of EIF4/p70S6K pathways were also significantly underrepresented in the exposures with a neutron component, but not in x-ray radiation.
29954325|ab|8|29954325|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The majority of the changed genes in these pathways belonged to the ribosome biogenesis and translation machinery and included several translation initiation factors (e.g. Eif2ak4, Eif3f), as well as 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits (e.g. Rsp19, Rpl19, Rpl27).
29954325|ab|9|29954325|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Many of the differentially downregulated ribosomal genes (e.g. RPS19, RPS28) have been causally associated with human bone marrow failure syndromes and hematologic malignancies.
29954325|ab|10|29954325|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We also observed downregulation of transfer RNA processes, in the neutron-only exposure (p < 0.005).
29954325|ab|11|29954325|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (p < 0.05) of differentially expressed genes predicted significantly suppressed activity of the upstream regulators c-Myc and Mycn, transcription factors known to control ribosome biogenesis.
29954325|ab|12|29954325|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We describe the gene expression profile of mouse blood following exposure to mixed field neutron/photon irradiation.
29954325|ab|13|29954325|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We have discovered that pathways related to protein translation are significantly underrepresented in the exposures containing a neutron component.

28282440|ab|1|28282440||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|A pandemic-capable influenza virus requires a hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein that is immunologically unseen by most people and is capable of supporting replication and transmission in humans.
28282440|ab|2|28282440||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|HA stabilization has been linked to 2009 pH1N1 pandemic potential in humans and H5N1 airborne transmissibility in the ferret model.
28282440|ab|3|28282440||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Swine have served as an intermediate host for zoonotic influenza viruses, yet the evolutionary pressure exerted by this host on HA stability was unknown.
28282440|ab|4|28282440||RESULTS|METHODS|For over 70 contemporary swine H1 and H3 isolates, we measured HA activation pH to range from pH 5.1 to 5.9 for H1 viruses and pH 5.3 to 5.8 for H3 viruses.
28282440|ab|5|28282440||RESULTS|RESULTS|Thus, contemporary swine isolates vary widely in HA stability, having values favored by both avian (pH >5.5) and human and ferret (pH </=5.5) species.
28282440|ab|6|28282440||RESULTS|METHODS|Using an early 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus backbone, we generated three viruses differing by one HA residue that only altered HA stability: WT (pH 5.5), HA1-Y17H (pH 6.0), and HA2-R106K (pH 5.3).
28282440|ab|7|28282440||RESULTS|RESULTS|All three replicated in pigs and transmitted from pig-to-pig and pig-to-ferret.
28282440|ab|8|28282440||RESULTS|RESULTS|WT and R106 viruses maintained HA genotype and phenotype after transmission.
28282440|ab|9|28282440||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Y17H (pH 6.0) acquired HA mutations that stabilized the HA protein to pH 5.8 after transmission to pigs and 5.5 after transmission to ferrets.
28282440|ab|10|28282440||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Overall, we found swine support a broad range of HA activation pH for contact transmission and many recent swine H1N1 and H3N2 isolates have stabilized (human-like) HA proteins.
28282440|ab|11|28282440||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|This constitutes a heightened pandemic risk and underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance and control efforts for swine viruses.
27085702|ab|1|27085702||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The small heat shock protein EtaspBeta5 (alphaB-crystallin) exhibits generally cytoprotective functions and possesses powerful neuroprotective capacity in the brain.
27085702|ab|2|27085702||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|However, little is known about the mode of action of EtaspBeta5 or other members of the HspB family particularly in neurons.
27085702|ab|3|27085702||RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|To get clues of the neuronal function of HspBs, we overexpressed several HspBs in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and investigated their effect on neuronal morphology and stress resistance.
27085702|ab|4|27085702||RESULTS|RESULTS|Whereas axon length and synapse density were not affected by any HspB, dendritic complexity was enhanced by HspB5 and, to a lesser extent, by HspB6.
27085702|ab|5|27085702||RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, we could show that this process was dependent on phosphorylation, since a non-phosphorylatable mutant of HspB5 did not show this effect.
27085702|ab|6|27085702||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|Rarefaction of the dendritic arbor is one hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases.
27085702|ab|7|27085702||RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|To investigate if HspB5, which is upregulated at pathophysiological conditions, might be able to protect dendrites during such situations, we exposed HspB5 overexpressing neuronal cultures to heat shock.
27085702|ab|8|27085702||CONCLUSIONS|METHODS|HspB5 prevented heat shock-induced rarefaction of dendrites.
27085702|ab|9|27085702||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|In conclusion, we identified regulation of dendritic complexity as a new function of HspB5 in hippocampal neurons.

29798813|ab|6|29798813|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was no significant change over time in paternal competence after controlling for various covariates.
29798813|ab|7|29798813|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Fathers who initially reported low levels of competence when their child was three reported continuously lower competence over time.
29798813|ab|8|29798813|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Family relationships, positive supports, and perceived helpfulness of home visits were significant predictors of paternal competence at age three.

29954444|ab|3|29954444|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The temporal trends in colorectal cancer incidence between 1983 and 2012 were analyzed with joinpoint regressions by sex, age groups, and anatomic sites among adults using data from the Hong Kong Cancer Registry.
29954444|ab|4|29954444|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|An age-period-cohort analysis was used to evaluate the effects of age, calendar periods, and birth cohorts on the observed temporal trends.
29954444|ab|5|29954444|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The incidence of colon cancer among those aged 50 years and older in both sexes increased steadily from 1983 until the mid-1990s and was followed by a slight decrease thereafter, whereas the incidence among those aged 20-49 years decreased steadily from 1983 to 2012.
29954444|ab|6|29954444|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In contrast, the incidence of rectal cancer steadily increased in men and remained stable in women throughout the study period.
29954444|ab|7|29954444|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Significant period and birth cohort effects were observed for colon cancer, whereas period effects on the temporal trends were observed for male rectal cancer.
29954444|ab|8|29954444|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The incidences of colon and rectal cancers have exhibited divergent patterns between 1983 and 2012 in Hong Kong, indicating heterogeneous etiologies between these two types of cancers.
29954444|ab|9|29954444|CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|CONCLUSIONS|Surveillance of the risk factors related to colon and rectal cancers in the Hong Kong population should be performed, and the increased rectal cancer incidence in males is worthy of extra attention.
27160271|ab|1|27160271||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|The aims of this study were to determine the central corneal thickness (CCT) and corneal curvature (CC) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to evaluate the correlations between the CCT, CC, RA activity, and RA duration.
27160271|ab|2|27160271||METHODS|METHODS|Fifty-four RA patients (104 eyes; 35 with dry eye, 69 without dry eye) and 21 age- and gender-matched control patients (42 eyes) were enrolled in the study.
27160271|ab|3|27160271||METHODS|METHODS|The CCT and CC were measured by ultrasonic pachymeter and autorefractor-keratometer, respectively.
27160271|ab|4|27160271||METHODS|METHODS|RA activity was assessed using the disease activity score (DAS) 28.
27160271|ab|5|27160271||RESULTS|METHODS|The independent samples' t test and Pearson correlation analysis were used in the statistical analyses.
27160271|ab|6|27160271||RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean CCTs were found to be 535.88 +/- 38.24, 530.46 +/- 32.88, 538.64 +/- 40.64, and 543.40 +/- 40.66 mum in all RA eyes, RA with dry eyes, RA without dry eyes, and control eyes, respectively.
27160271|ab|7|27160271||RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean keratometry (K) readings were found to be 43.84 +/- 1.76, 43.73 +/- 1.23, 43.90 +/- 1.98, and 43.60 +/- 1.48 D in all RA eyes, RA with dry eyes, RA without dry eyes, and control eyes, respectively.
27160271|ab|8|27160271||RESULTS|RESULTS|There were no significant differences in CCT values (p values, 0.293, 0.134, and 0.550, respectively) and K readings (p values, 0.435, 0.681, and 0.402, respectively) between the RA and control eyes.
27160271|ab|9|27160271||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings led us to the conclusion that the CCT and K readings were not significantly associated with DAS (p values, 0.678 and 0.812, respectively) and RA duration (p values, 0.108 and 0.080, respectively).
27160271|ab|10|27160271||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our results show that CCTs and CCs were not significantly different between the RA eyes and control eyes.

26994938|ab|1|26994938||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The evidence regarding recommendations of calorie restriction as part of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss in obese older adults has remained equivocal for more than a decade.
26994938|ab|2|26994938||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The older adult population is the fastest growing segment of the US population and a greater proportion of them are entering old age obese.
26994938|ab|3|26994938||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|These older adults require treatments based on solid evidence.
26994938|ab|4|26994938||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Therefore the purpose of this review is three-fold: 1) to provide a more current status of the knowledge regarding recommendations of calorie restriction as part of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss in obese older adults, 2) to determine what benefits and/or risks calorie restriction adds to exercise interventions in obese older adults, and 3) to consider not only outcomes related to changes in body composition, bone health, cardiometabolic disease risk, markers of inflammation, and physical function, but, also patient-centered outcomes that evaluate changes in cognitive status, quality of life, out-of-pocket costs, and mortality.
26994938|ab|5|26994938||RESULTS|METHODS|Seven randomized controlled trials were identified that examined calorie restriction while controlling for exercise intervention effects.
26994938|ab|6|26994938||RESULTS|RESULTS|Overall, the studies found that calorie restriction combined with exercise is effective for weight loss.
26994938|ab|7|26994938||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Evidence was mixed regarding other outcomes.
26994938|ab|8|26994938||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The risk-benefit ratio regarding calorie restriction in older adults remains uncertain.
26994938|ab|9|26994938||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Greater long-term follow-up is necessary, and complementary effectiveness studies are needed to identify strategies currently used by obese older adults in community settings.
27454163|ab|1|27454163||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In a similar way to high-dose exposures to low-LET radiations, cells show difficulties reaching mitosis after high-LET radiation exposure.
27454163|ab|2|27454163||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|For this reason, techniques have been proposed that are able to analyze chromosome aberrations in interphase by prematurely condensing the chromosomes (PCC-techniques).
27454163|ab|3|27454163||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Few dose-effect curves for high-LET radiation types have been reported, and none for alpha-particles.
27454163|ab|4|27454163||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to evaluate, by chemically-induced PCC, the chromosome aberrations induced by several doses of alpha-particles.
27454163|ab|5|27454163||METHODS|METHODS|Monolayers of peripheral lymphocytes were exposed to an alpha-source of Americium-241 with a mean energy entering the cells of 2.7 MeV.
27454163|ab|6|27454163||METHODS|METHODS|Lymphocytes were exposed to 10 doses, from 0-2.5 Gy, and then cultured for 48 h.
27454163|ab|7|27454163||RESULTS|METHODS|Colcemid and Calyculin-A were added at 24 and 1 h before harvesting, respectively.
27454163|ab|8|27454163||RESULTS|RESULTS|During microscope analysis, chromosome rings and extra chromosome pieces were scored in G2/M-PCC and M cells, while dicentric chromosomes were only scored in M cells.
27454163|ab|9|27454163||RESULTS|RESULTS|As the dose increased, fewer cells were able to reach mitosis and the proportion of G2/M-PCC cells increased.
27454163|ab|10|27454163||RESULTS|RESULTS|Chromosome rings were hardly observed in M cells when compared to G2/M-PCC cells.
27454163|ab|11|27454163||RESULTS|RESULTS|Extra fragments were more frequent than rings in both G2/M-PCC and M cells, but with lower frequencies than in G2/M-PCC cells.
27454163|ab|12|27454163||RESULTS|RESULTS|The distribution of dicentrics and extra fragments showed a clear overdispersion; this was not so evident for rings.
27454163|ab|13|27454163||RESULTS|RESULTS|The dose-effect curves obtained fitted very well to a linear model.
27454163|ab|14|27454163||RESULTS|RESULTS|Damaged cells after alpha-particle irradiation show more difficulties in reaching mitosis than cells exposed to gamma-rays.
27454163|ab|15|27454163||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|After alpha-particle irradiation the frequency of all the chromosome aberrations considered increased linearly with the dose, and alpha-particles clearly produced more dicentrics and extra chromosome pieces with respect to gamma-rays.
27454163|ab|16|27454163||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|After alpha-particle exposure, the existence of extra chromosome fragments in PCC cells seems to be a good candidate for use as a biomarker for dose assessment.
27454163|ab|17|27454163||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|However, the observed frequencies of different types of chromosomal aberrations could be influenced by some methodological aspects; for this reason, and in order to avoid possible methodological bias, standardization of the technique will be desirable.

28644059|ab|1|28644059||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|A series of new derivatives was prepared by derivatisation of the 7-amino moiety present in 7-amino-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one, a compound investigated earlier as CAI.
28644059|ab|2|28644059||METHODS|METHODS|The derivatisation was achieved by: i) reaction with arylsulfonyl isocyanates/aryl isocyanates; (ii) reaction with fluorescein isothiocyanate; (iii) condensation with substituted benzoic acids in the presence of carbodiimides; (iv) reaction with 2,4,6-trimethyl-pyrylium tetrafluoroborate; (v) reaction with methylsulfonyl chloride and (vi) reaction with maleic anhydride.
28644059|ab|3|28644059||RESULTS|METHODS|The new compounds were assayed as inhibitors of four carbonic anhydrases (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) human (h) isoforms of pharmacologic relevance, the cytosolic hCA I and II, the membrane-anchored hCA IV and the transmembrane, tumour-associated hCA IX.
28644059|ab|4|28644059||RESULTS|RESULTS|hCA IX was the most inhibited isoform (KIs ranging between 243.6 and 2785.6 nm) whereas hCA IV was not inhibited by these compounds.

29803146|ab|1|29803146|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Daily ambulation with a prosthesis often involves turning to negotiate within the home and community environments, however how people with lower limb loss perform turns is infrequently studied.
29803146|ab|2|29803146|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Administering a common clinical outcome measure to capture turn performance data provides a convenient means of assessing this ubiquitous activity.
29803146|ab|3|29803146|RESEARCH QUESTION|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|What temporal-spatial parameters are exhibited by people with unilateral lower limb amputation while performing a 180 turn task?
29803146|ab|4|29803146|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Forty community-ambulating subjects with unilateral lower limb amputation (20 transtibial amputees, 20 transfemoral amputees) performed the Component Timed-Up-and-Go (cTUG) test turning once in each direction, both toward the intact and toward the prosthetic limb.
29803146|ab|5|29803146|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|An instrumented walkway captured temporal-spatial parameters during performance of the 180 turn task of the cTUG, while a custom iPad application recorded time and number of steps to perform the turn.
29803146|ab|6|29803146|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Comparisons between turn direction and level of amputation during the cTUG and temporal-spatial results were assessed.
29803146|ab|7|29803146|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|People with lower limb amputation spent more time on their intact limb while turning than their prosthetic limb regardless of the position of the intact limb, and those with transfemoral amputation spent significantly more time over the intact limb than those with transtibial amputation.
29803146|ab|8|29803146|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Additionally, subjects with transfemoral amputation performed the turn significantly faster when turning with an inner intact limb.
29803146|ab|9|29803146|SIGNIFICANCE|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Amputees use different movement strategies with altered temporal-spatial characteristics to turn depending on the direction of the turn and the level of amputation.
29803146|ab|10|29803146|SIGNIFICANCE|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Clinical use of the cTUG could provide evidence supporting prosthetic prescription practice and introduction of novel physical therapy interventions for individuals with lower limb amputation.

29952747|ab|1|29952747|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Brain connectome research based on graph theoretical analysis shows that small-world topological properties play an important role in the structural and functional alterations observed in patients with psychiatric disorders.
29952747|ab|2|29952747|BACKGROUND|METHODS|BACKGROUND|However, the reported global topological alterations in small-world properties are controversial, are not consistently conceptualized according to agreed-upon criteria, and are not critically examined for consistent alterations in patients with each major psychiatric disorder.
29952747|ab|3|29952747|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Based on a comprehensive PubMed search, we systematically reviewed studies using noninvasive neuroimaging data and graph theoretical approaches for 6 major psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
29952747|ab|4|29952747|METHODS|RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|Here, we describe the main patterns of altered small-world properties and then systematically review the evidence for these alterations in the structural and functional connectome in patients with these disorders.
29952747|ab|5|29952747|RESULTS|RESULTS|METHODS|We selected 40 studies of schizophrenia, 33 studies of MDD, 5 studies of ADHD, 5 studies of BD, 7 studies of OCD and 5 studies of PTSD.
29952747|ab|6|29952747|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The following 4 patterns of altered small-world properties are defined from the perspectives of segregation and integration: "regularization," "randomization," "stronger small-worldization" and "weaker small-worldization."
29952747|ab|7|29952747|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Although more differences than similarities are noted in patients with these disorders, a prominent trend is the structural regularization versus functional randomization in patients with schizophrenia.
29952747|ab|8|29952747|LIMITATIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, preprocessing steps and analytical methods can produce contradictory results, increasing the difficulty of integrating results across different studies.
29952747|ab|9|29952747|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Four psychoradiological patterns of altered small-world properties are proposed.
29952747|ab|10|29952747|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The analysis of altered small-world properties may provide novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders from a connectomic perspective.
29952747|ab|11|29952747|CONCLUSION|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|In future connectome studies, the global network measures of both segregation and integration should be calculated to fully evaluate altered small-world properties in patients with a particular disease.

29956335|ab|1|29956335|PURPOSE|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|To study, using phantoms made from biological tissues, the feasibility and practical challenges of monitoring the position of the radiation beam and the deposited dose by x-ray acoustic computed tomography (XACT) during external beam radiotherapy delivery.
29956335|ab|2|29956335|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A prototype XACT system with a single immersion ultrasound transducer, which was positioned around the target sample driven by a motor-controlled rotation stage, was used to acquire the x-ray acoustic (XA) signals produced by a medical linear accelerator (Linac) to form an XACT image of the irradiated phantom.
29956335|ab|3|29956335|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|To investigate the feasibility of XACT in tracking the position of radiation dose, a large piece of veal liver with embedded fat tissue was imaged and beam misalignments were measured.
29956335|ab|4|29956335|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Next, we explored the sensitivity of XACT in monitoring and quantifying the delivered dose, in which a block of porcine gel was embedded with equally spaced lard cylinders and imaged.
29956335|ab|5|29956335|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The doses on the lard cylinders modulated by physical wedges were quantified from the XACT image and were verified by comparison to measurements from radiochromic films as the gold standard.
29956335|ab|6|29956335|MATERIAL AND METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Then, to simulate how XACT can perform in a targeted tissue in the human body, a porcine gel phantom with lard cylinders covered by different materials (bone, muscle, and air gap, respectively) was also imaged.
29956335|ab|7|29956335|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The reconstructed XACT images of the phantoms show congruence with the boundaries of the beam field and the interfaces between the different tissue materials.
29956335|ab|8|29956335|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The beam displacement from the target was tracked properly by the reconstructed XACT images.
29956335|ab|9|29956335|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|An intensity difference as small as 2.9% in delivered dose region can be measured from XACT images P = 0.02.
29956335|ab|10|29956335|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The intensities of XACT images were highly correlated to the film measurements with an R(2) better than 0.986.
29956335|ab|11|29956335|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The expected variances of dose delivered to different target regions as a result of the difference in attenuation were successfully captured by the XACT images.

27355427|ab|8|27355427||RESULTS|RESULTS|A significant correlation was also found between IED errors and non-planning impulsivity from the BIS.
27355427|ab|9|27355427||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Linear regression models based on total IED errors, extra-dimensional (ED) shift errors, or pre-ED shift errors indicated that these factors accounted for a significant portion of the variance noted in several variables.
27355427|ab|10|27355427||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings suggest that cognitive flexibility may be an important consideration in the assessment of gamblers.
27355427|ab|11|27355427||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Results from correlational and linear regression analyses support this possibility, but the exact contributions of both impulsivity and cognitive flexibility remain entangled.
27355427|ab|12|27355427||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Future studies will ideally be able to assess the longitudinal relationships between gambling, compulsivity, and impulsivity, helping to clarify the relative contributions of both impulsive and compulsive features.

29803014|ab|1|29803014|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Critical care nurses have been involved in Rapid Response Teams since their inception, particularly in medically led RRTs, known as Medical Emergency Teams.
29803014|ab|2|29803014|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is assumed that critical care skills are required to escalate care for the deteriorating ward patient.
29803014|ab|3|29803014|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, evidence to support critical care nurses' involvement in METs is anecdotal.
29803014|ab|4|29803014|INTRODUCTION|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Currently, little is known about the educational requirements for nurses involved in RRT or METs.
29803014|ab|5|29803014|OBJECTIVES|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|We aimed to identify and describe what nurses involved in a MET consider the most vital areas of knowledge and skill when delivering care to the deteriorating ward patient.
29803014|ab|6|29803014|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|An exploratory descriptive design was used and data was collected at a session of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Rapid Response Team (ANZICS-RRT) Conference held at The Gold Coast, Australia in July 2015.
29803014|ab|7|29803014|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|All conference delegates were eligible to take part.
29803014|ab|8|29803014|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Conference delegates totalled 293; 194 nurses, 89 doctors and 10 allied health professionals.
29803014|ab|9|29803014|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Data collection took place in three phases, over a 90-minute period.
29803014|ab|10|29803014|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|First, demographic data were collected from all participants at the start of data collection.
29803014|ab|11|29803014|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|These data were collected using paper-based surveys.
29803014|ab|12|29803014|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Second, extended response surveys; that is, paper-based surveys that asked open-ended questions to elicit free text responses, were used to collect participants' individual responses to the question: "What are the specific theoretical knowledge, skills and behavioural attributes required in a curricula to prepare nurses to be high functioning members of a MET?"
29803014|ab|13|29803014|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Demographic, educational and work characteristics were descriptively analysed using SPSS (version 22).
29803014|ab|14|29803014|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Participants perceptions of what knowledge, skills and attributes are required for nurses to recognise and respond to clinical deterioration were thematically analysed.
29803014|ab|15|29803014|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Participants were predominantly female (88.3%, n=91) with 54.4% (n=56) holding a Bachelor of Nursing.
29803014|ab|16|29803014|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Participants had a median of 20years (IQR 16) experience as RNs, and a median of 14years (IQR 13) experience in critical care.
29803014|ab|17|29803014|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Participants formed part of METs frequently, with nearly half the cohort seeing clinically deteriorating patients more than once per day (37.9%, n=33) or daily (10%, n=9).
29803014|ab|18|29803014|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Thematic analysis of survey responses revealed four main themes desired in Rapid Response Team Curricula: Clinical Deterioration Theory, Clinical Deterioration Skills, Rapid Response System Governance, and Professionalism and Teamwork.
29803014|ab|19|29803014|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|We suggest that a curriculum that educates nurses on the specific requirements of assessing, managing and evaluating all aspects of clinical deterioration is now required.

29953015|ab|5|29953015|INTERVENTIONS|METHODS|RESULTS|Both patients exhibited similar presentation of unusual extrapyramidal motor response of the affected limb following lumbar sympathetic block.
29953015|ab|6|29953015|INTERVENTIONS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Both patients were treated with intravenous diphenhydramine to abort the extrapyramidal motor response.
29953015|ab|7|29953015|OUTCOMES|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Both patients similarly responded to treatment with intravenous diphenhydramine with abrupt resolution of the motor response.
29953015|ab|8|29953015|LESSONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Sympathetic blockade may interfere with the adaptive autonomic reflex circuits of the motor balance homeostasis in patients with complex regional pain syndrome.
29953015|ab|9|29953015|LESSONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Disinhibition of extrapyramidal system may lead to immediate expression of extrapyramidal signs following the sympathetic block.
29953015|ab|10|29953015|LESSONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Diphenhydramine, with its anti-histaminic and anticholinergic properties, may be effective in aborting such extrapyramidal signs, and should be considered as a treatment option in similar cases.
28226245|ab|1|28226245||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Corneal inflammation is often encountered as a key pathological event in many corneal diseases.
28226245|ab|2|28226245||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Current treatments involve topical corticosteroids which require frequent instillations due to rapid tear turnover, causing side-effects such as corneal toxicity and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).
28226245|ab|3|28226245||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Hence, new interventions that can reduce side effects, dosing frequency, and increase patient compliance can be highly beneficial.
28226245|ab|4|28226245||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|In this study, we explore a subconjunctival injectable gel based on G4-PAMAM dendrimer and hyaluronic acid, cross-linked using thiol-ene click chemistry, incorporated with dendrimer dexamethasone (D-Dex) conjugates as a potential strategy for sustained delivery and enhanced bioavailability of corticosteroids.
28226245|ab|5|28226245||METHODS|METHODS|The efficacy of the injectable gel formulation was evaluated in a rat mild alkali burn model.
28226245|ab|6|28226245||RESULTS|METHODS|Fluorescently-labelled dendrimers (D-Cy5) incorporated in the gel release D-Cy5 in vivo.
28226245|ab|7|28226245||METHODS|RESULTS|The released D-Cy5 selectively targets and localizes within corneal macrophages in inflamed rat cornea but not in healthy controls.
28226245|ab|8|28226245||METHODS|METHODS|This pathology dependent biodistribution was exploited for drug delivery, by incorporating D-Dex in the injectable gel.
28226245|ab|9|28226245||RESULTS|METHODS|The attenuation of corneal inflammation by D-Dex gels was assessed using various clinical and biochemical parameters over a 2-week period.
28226245|ab|10|28226245||RESULTS|RESULTS|Subconjunctival D-Dex gel treatment resulted in favorable clinically-relevant outcomes with reduced central corneal thickness and improved corneal clarity compared to free-Dex and placebo gel controls.
28226245|ab|11|28226245||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The extent of corneal neovascularization was significantly reduced in the D-Dex group.
28226245|ab|12|28226245||RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings suggest that D-Dex attenuates corneal inflammation more effectively than free-Dex by attenuating macrophage infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression.
28226245|ab|13|28226245||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|A significant elevation in IOP was not observed in the D-Dex group but was observed in the free-Dex group.
28226245|ab|14|28226245||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|This novel injectable D-Dex gel may be a potential drug delivery platform for the treatment of many inflammatory ocular surface disorders such as dry eye, auto-immune keratitis and post-surgical complications where frequent steroid administration is required.
29958221|ab|1|29958221|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Cardiotoxic effects of local anesthetics (LAs) involve inhibition of NaV1.5 voltage-gated Na channels.
29958221|ab|2|29958221|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Metastatic breast and colon cancer cells also express NaV1.5, predominantly the neonatal splice variant (nNaV1.5) and their inhibition by LAs reduces invasion and migration.
29958221|ab|3|29958221|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It may be advantageous to target cancer cells while sparing cardiac function through selective blockade of nNaV1.5 and/or by preferentially affecting inactivated NaV1.5, which predominate in cancer cells.
29958221|ab|4|29958221|BACKGROUND|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|We tested the hypotheses that lidocaine and levobupivacaine differentially affect (1) adult (aNaV1.5) and nNaV1.5 and (2) the resting and inactivated states of NaV1.5.
29958221|ab|5|29958221|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was used to evaluate the actions of lidocaine and levobupivacaine on recombinant NaV1.5 channels expressed in HEK-293 cells.
29958221|ab|6|29958221|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding either aNaV1.5 or nNaV1.5.
29958221|ab|7|29958221|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Voltage protocols were applied to determine depolarizing potentials that either activated or inactivated 50% of maximum conductance (V(1/2) activation and V(1/2) inactivation, respectively).
29958221|ab|8|29958221|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Lidocaine and levobupivacaine potently inhibited aNaV1.5 (IC50 mean [SD]: 20 [22] and 1 [0.6] microM, respectively) and nNaV1.5 (IC50 mean [SD]: 17 [10] and 3 [1.6] microM, respectively) at a holding potential of -80 mV.
29958221|ab|9|29958221|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|IC50s differed significantly between lidocaine and levobupivacaine with no influence of splice variant.
29958221|ab|10|29958221|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Levobupivacaine induced a statistically significant depolarizing shift in the V(1/2) activation for aNaV1.5 (mean [SD] from -32 [4.6] mV to -26 [8.1] mV) but had no effect on the voltage dependence of activation of nNaV1.5.
29958221|ab|11|29958221|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Lidocaine had no effect on V(1/2) activation of either variant but caused a significantly greater depression of maximum current mediated by nNaV1.5 compared to aNaV1.5.
29958221|ab|12|29958221|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Similar statistically significant shifts in the V(1/2) inactivation (approximately -10 mV) occurred for both LAs and NaV1.5 variants.
29958221|ab|13|29958221|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Levobupivacaine (1 microM) caused a significantly greater slowing of recovery from inactivation of both variants than did lidocaine (10 microM).
29958221|ab|14|29958221|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Both LAs caused approximately 50% tonic inhibition of aNaV1.5 or nNaV1.5 when holding at -80 mV.
29958221|ab|15|29958221|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Neither LA caused tonic block at a holding potential of either -90 or -120 mV, voltages at which there was little steady-state inactivation.
29958221|ab|16|29958221|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Higher concentrations of either lidocaine (300 microM) or levobupivacaine (100 microM) caused significantly more tonic block at -120 mV.
29958221|ab|17|29958221|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|These data demonstrate that low concentrations of the LAs exhibit inactivation-dependent block of NaV1.5, which may provide a rationale for their use to safely inhibit migration and invasion by metastatic cancer cells without cardiotoxicity.
29952817|ab|1|29952817|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|One important example of impaired motor function after surgery is diaphragmatic dysfunction after upper abdominal surgery.
29952817|ab|2|29952817|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|In this study, the authors directly recorded efferent phrenic nerve activity and determined the effect of the upper abdominal incision.
29952817|ab|3|29952817|BACKGROUND|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|The authors hypothesized that phrenic motor output would be decreased after the upper abdominal incision; it was also hypothesized that blocking sensory input from the incision using thoracic epidural anesthesia would diminish this incision-induced change in phrenic motor activity.
29952817|ab|4|29952817|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Efferent phrenic activity was recorded 1 h to 10 days after upper abdominal incision in urethane-anesthetized rats.
29952817|ab|5|29952817|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Ventilatory parameters were measured in unanesthetized rats using whole-body plethysmography at multiple time points after incision.
29952817|ab|6|29952817|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|The authors then determined the effect of thoracic epidural anesthesia on phrenic nerve activity and ventilatory parameters after incision.
29952817|ab|7|29952817|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Phrenic motor output remained reduced by approximately 40% 1 h and 1 day after incision, but was not different from the sham group by postoperative day 10.
29952817|ab|8|29952817|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|One day after incision (n = 9), compared to sham-operated animals (n = 7), there was a significant decrease in spike frequency area-under-the-curve (median [interquartile range]: 54.0 [48.7 to 84.4] vs.
29952817|ab|9|29952817|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|97.8 [88.7 to 130.3]; P = 0.0184), central respiratory rate (0.71 [0.63 to 0.79] vs. 0.86 [0.82 to 0.93]/s; P = 0.0460), and inspiratory-to-expiratory duration ratio (0.46 [0.44 to 0.55] vs. 0.78 [0.72 to 0.93]; P = 0.0023).
29952817|ab|10|29952817|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Unlike humans, a decrease, not an increase, in breathing frequency has been observed after the abdominal incision in whole-body plethysmography.
29952817|ab|11|29952817|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Thoracic epidural anesthesia attenuated the incision-induced changes in phrenic motor output and ventilatory parameters.
29952817|ab|12|29952817|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Upper abdominal incision decreased phrenic motor output and ventilatory parameters, and this incision-induced impairment was attenuated by thoracic epidural anesthesia.
29952817|ab|13|29952817|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|The authors' results provide direct evidence that afferent inputs from the upper abdominal incision induce reflex inhibition of phrenic motor activity.

29956632|ab|1|29956632|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In women, changes in estrogen levels may increase incidence and/or symptomatology of depression and affect the response to antidepressant treatments.
29956632|ab|2|29956632|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Estrogen therapy in females may provide some mood benefits as a single treatment, or might augment clinical response to antidepressants that inhibit serotonin reuptake.
29956632|ab|3|29956632|OBJECTIVE|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|We analyzed the mechanisms of estradiol action involved in the regulation of gene expression that modulate serotonin neurotransmission implicated in depression.
29956632|ab|4|29956632|METHOD|RESULTS|METHODS|Publications were identified by a literature search on PubMed.
29956632|ab|5|29956632|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The participation of estradiol in depression may include regulation of the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase-2, monoamine oxidase A and B, serotonin transporter and serotonin-1A receptor.
29956632|ab|6|29956632|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|This effect is mediated by estradiol binding to intracellular estrogen receptor that interacts with estrogen response elements in the promoter sequences of tryptophan hydroxylase-2, serotonin transporter and monoamine oxidase-B.
29956632|ab|7|29956632|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|In addition to directly binding deoxyribonucleic acid, estrogen receptor can tether to other transcription factors, including activator protein 1, specificity protein 1, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta and nuclear factor kappa B to regulate gene promoters that lack estrogen response elements, such as monoamine oxidase-A and serotonin 1A receptor.
29956632|ab|8|29956632|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Estradiol increases tryptophan hydroxylase-2 and serotonin transporter expression and decreases the expression of serotonin 1A receptor and monoamine oxidase A and B through the interaction with its intracellular receptors.
29956632|ab|9|29956632|CONCLUSION|OBJECTIVE|CONCLUSIONS|The understanding of molecular mechanisms of estradiol regulation on the protein expression that modulates serotonin neurotransmission will be helpful for development of new and more effective treatment for women with depression.
29803694|ab|1|29803694|OBJECTIVES|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect procedural outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the ACURATE neo prosthesis (Symetis/Boston, Ecublens, Switzerland).
29803694|ab|2|29803694|BACKGROUND|METHODS|BACKGROUND|Predictors of procedural outcomes using the ACURATE neo prosthesis are poorly understood.
29803694|ab|3|29803694|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 500 patients underwent transfemoral aortic valve replacement with the ACURATE neo prosthesis.
29803694|ab|4|29803694|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Device landing zone calcification was stratified as severe, moderate, or mild.
29803694|ab|5|29803694|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Anatomic and procedural predictors of second-degree or greater paravalvular leakage and permanent pacemaker implantation were assessed.
29803694|ab|6|29803694|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Post-procedural second-degree or greater paravalvular leakage was more frequent with increasing device landing zone calcification (mild 0.8% vs. moderate 5.0% vs. severe 13.0%, p < 0.001), whereas permanent pacemaker implantation was independent of device landing zone calcification.
29803694|ab|7|29803694|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|More severe periannular calcification (odds ratio [OR]: 1.007; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.003 to 1.010; p < 0.001), less oversizing (OR: 0.867; 95% CI: 0.773 to 0.971; p = 0.014), the presence of annular plaque protrusions (OR: 2.756; 95% CI: 1.138 to 6.670; p = 0.025), and aortic movement of the delivery system after full deployment (OR: 5.593; 95% CI: 1.299 to 24.076; p = 0.02), and sinotubular junction height (OR: 1.156; 95% CI: 1.007 to 1.328; p = 0.04) independently predicted second-degree or greater paravalvular leakage.
29803694|ab|8|29803694|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation were pre-existing right bundle branch block (OR: 3.122; 95% CI: 1.261 to 7.731; p = 0.01) and more oversizing (OR: 1.111; 95% CI: 1.009 to 1.222; p = 0.03).
29803694|ab|9|29803694|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the ACURATE neo device predominantly depends on careful patient selection with appropriate oversizing and taking into account the individual anatomy and calcium distribution of the aortic root.

29848281|ab|2|29848281|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Dysregulation of Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) activity gives rise to numerous neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative related disorders that affect the whole central nervous system.
29848281|ab|3|29848281|OBJECTIVE|METHODS|BACKGROUND|By the sequential application of in-silico tools, efforts have been attempted to design the novel GSK-3beta inhibitors.
29848281|ab|4|29848281|METHOD|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Owing to the potential role of GSK-3beta in nervous disorders, we have attempted to develop the quantitative four featured pharmacophore model comprising two Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA), one Ring Aromatic (RA), and one Hydrophobe (HY), which were further affirmed by costfunction analysis, rm2 matrices, internal and external test set validation and Guner-Henry (GH) scoring analysis.
29848281|ab|5|29848281|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|Validated pharmacophoric model was used for virtual screening and out of 345 compounds, two potential virtual hits were finalized that were on the basis of fit value, estimated activity and Lipinski's violation.

29954311|ab|1|29954311|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To compare the prevalence of multimorbidity and its impact on mortality among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians who had been hospitalised in New South Wales in the previous 10 years.
29954311|ab|2|29954311|OBJECTIVES|METHODS|METHODS|Cohort study analysis of linked NSW hospital (Admitted Patient Data Collection) and mortality data for 5 437 018 New South Wales residents with an admission to a NSW hospital between 1 March 2003 and 1 March 2013, and alive at 1 March 2013.
29954311|ab|3|29954311|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES|METHODS|METHODS|Admissions for 30 morbidities during the 10-year study period were identified.
29954311|ab|4|29954311|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES|RESULTS|METHODS|The primary outcome was the presence or absence of multimorbidity during the 10-year lookback period; the secondary outcome was mortality in the 12 months from 1 March 2013 to 1 March 2014.
29954311|ab|5|29954311|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|31.5% of Aboriginal patients had at least one morbidity and 16.1% had two or more, compared with 25.0% and 12.1% of non-Aboriginal patients.
29954311|ab|6|29954311|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|After adjusting for age, sex, and socio-economic status, the prevalence of multimorbidity among Aboriginal people was 2.59 times that for non-Aboriginal people (95% CI, 2.55-2.62).
29954311|ab|7|29954311|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The prevalence of multimorbidity was higher among Aboriginal people in all age groups, in younger age groups because of the higher prevalence of mental morbidities, and from age 60 because of physical morbidities.
29954311|ab|8|29954311|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The age-, sex- and socio-economic status-adjusted hazard of one-year mortality (Aboriginal v non-Aboriginal Australians) was 2.43 (95% CI, 2.24-2.62), and 1.51 (95% CI, 1.39-1.63) after also adjusting for morbidity count.
29954311|ab|9|29954311|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The prevalence of multimorbidity was higher among Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal patients, and this difference accounted for much of the difference in mortality between the two groups.
29954311|ab|10|29954311|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Evidence-based interventions for reducing multimorbidity among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians must be a priority.
28440735|ab|1|28440735||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor known to induce the expression of a variety of antioxidant and detoxification genes.
28440735|ab|2|28440735||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Recently, increasing evidence has revealed roles for Nrf2 in glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism; however, the exact functions of Nrf2 in hepatocyte biology are largely unclear.
28440735|ab|3|28440735||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|In the current study, the transient knockdown of Nrf2 via siRNA transfection enhanced the glucose uptake of fasting AML12 hepatocytes to 325.3 +/- 11.1% ( P < 0.05) of that of untransfected control cells.
28440735|ab|4|28440735||RESULTS|METHODS|The impacts of Nrf2 knockdown (NK) on the antioxidant system, inflammatory response, and glucose metabolism were then examined in AML12 cells under both high-glucose (33 mmol/L) and low-glucose (4.5 mmol/L) conditions.
28440735|ab|5|28440735||RESULTS|RESULTS|NK lowered the gene and protein expression of the anti-oxidases heme oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 and increased p-eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha(S51), p-nuclear factor-kappaB p65(S276), and its downstream proinflammatory factors, including interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and matrix metalloproteinase 9, at the protein level.
28440735|ab|6|28440735||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|NK also altered the protein expression of fibroblast growth factor 21, glucose transporter type 4, insulin-like growth factor 1, forkhead box protein O1, p-AKT(S473), and p-GSK3alpha/beta(Y279/Y216), which are involved in glucose uptake, glycogenesis, and gluconeogenesis in AML12 cells.
28440735|ab|7|28440735||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the central role of Nrf2 in the regulation of glucose metabolism in AML12 hepatocytes, in addition to its classical roles in the regulation of redox signaling, endoplasmic reticulum stress and proinflammatory responses, and support the potential of Nrf2 as a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of obesity and other associated metabolic syndromes.
28440735|ab|8|28440735||RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|Impact statement Increasing evidence supports the complexity of Nrf2 functions beyond the antioxidant and detoxification response.
28440735|ab|9|28440735||RESULTS|RESULTS|Previous in vivo studies employing either Nrf2-knockout or Nrf2-activated mice have achieved a similar endpoint: protection against an obese and insulin-resistant phenotype that includes impaired lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis in the liver.
28440735|ab|10|28440735||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|These apparently paradoxical observations led us to evaluate the impact of Nrf2 in liver cells in the absence of any influence from the systemic environment, including changes in the secretion of adipokines and proinflammatory cytokines by adipose tissues.
28440735|ab|11|28440735||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In the present study, Nrf2 knockdown was sufficient to induce fundamental changes in the glucose metabolism of AML12 hepatocytes in addition to its classical cytoprotective functions.
28440735|ab|12|28440735||OBJECTIVE|CONCLUSIONS|We also discuss similarities and differences between our in vitro study and previous in vivo studies, which may be helpful to dissect and better understand in vivo data that represents the culmination of both local and systemic alterations.
29956489|ab|1|29956489|OBJECTIVE|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|The goal of this study was to determine attitudes and practices of physicians in training with respect to the evaluation and treatment of obesity.
29956489|ab|2|29956489|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Resident-generated admission and discharge notes of all 1,765 general medicine hospital admissions during 4 nonconsecutive months were analyzed, and any references to weight, obesity, BMI, adiposity, and body fat were identified.
29956489|ab|3|29956489|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|The full general resident cohort was then surveyed for perceptions and behaviors related to obesity.
29956489|ab|4|29956489|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Obesity was considered a highly important medical issue by 98.5% of residents; 90% correctly identified a class II obesity Stunkard phenotype, and 80% accurately calculated a BMI given height and weight in metric units.
29956489|ab|5|29956489|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Residents overestimated inpatient obesity prevalence (estimate = 75%; actual = 35%) and the rate of obesity recording in the hospital admission note (estimate = 94%; actual = 49.5%).
29956489|ab|6|29956489|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|A BMI or current weight in the admission note or discharge summary was reported in none of the 1,765 patient records, and only 6% of the patients with obesity had obesity noted in either the inpatient admission or discharge assessment or plan.
29956489|ab|7|29956489|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Though residents recognize obesity and its clinical implications, it is underreported in the assessment of inpatients.
29956489|ab|8|29956489|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|This low level of documenting obesity and its impact on clinical care planning underscores a missed opportunity to establish appropriate referrals and initiate treatment at a clinically opportune time.
29806679|ab|1|29806679|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|International guidelines suggest a screening panel for monoclonal gammopathies that contains serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), free light chain (FLC) measurements and immunofixation.
29806679|ab|2|29806679|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|This combination provides the possibility of a timely accurate diagnosis.
29806679|ab|3|29806679|AIM|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|To evaluate the sensibility of a simple screening panel (SPE + FLC).
29806679|ab|4|29806679|MATERIAL AND METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|We analyzed 191 consecutive serum samples of patients with a suspected monoclonal gammopathy (MG).
29806679|ab|5|29806679|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Seventy five patients were diagnosed with MG.
29806679|ab|6|29806679|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The sensitivity and specificity of the combination of SPE + FLC for the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy were 95% (95% confidence intervals 89-99) and 99% (95% confidence intervals 96-100), respectively.
29806679|ab|7|29806679|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|We were able to validate the international recommendations on the diagnostic accuracy of this simple combination of two tests in serum for monoclonal gammopathy.
29954327|ab|1|29954327|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Anuran metamorphosis, which is obligatorily initiated and sustained by thyroid hormone (TH), is a dramatic example of extensive morphological, biochemical and cellular changes occurring during post-embryonic development.
29954327|ab|2|29954327|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Thus, it provides an ideal model to understand the actions of the hormone and molecular mechanisms underlying these developmental and apoptotic processes.
29954327|ab|3|29954327|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In addition to transcriptional factors, microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in diverse biological processes via post-transcriptional repression of mRNAs.
29954327|ab|4|29954327|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, the possible role of miRNAs in anuran metamorphosis is not well understood.
29954327|ab|5|29954327|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Screening and identification of TH-responding miRNAs are required to reveal the integrated regulatory mechanisms of TH during metamorphosis.
29954327|ab|6|29954327|BACKGROUND|RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|Given the specific role of TRs during M. fissipes metamorphosis and the characteristics of M. fissipes as an ideal model, Illumina sequencing technology was employed to get a full scope of miRNA in M. fissipes metamorphosis treated by T3.
29954327|ab|7|29954327|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Morphological and histological analysis revealed that 24 h T3 treatment M. fissipes tadpoles resembled that at the climax of natural metamorphosis.
29954327|ab|8|29954327|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Thus, small RNA libraries were constructed from control and 24 h T3 treatment groups.
29954327|ab|9|29954327|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A total of 164 conserved miRNAs and 36 predicted novel miRNAs were characterized.
29954327|ab|10|29954327|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, 5' first and ninth nucleotides of miRNAs were significantly enriched in U in our study.
29954327|ab|11|29954327|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In all, 21 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the T3 and control groups (p < 0.01).
29954327|ab|12|29954327|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A total of 10,206 unigenes were identified as target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs.
29954327|ab|13|29954327|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the most overrepresented miRNA target genes were enriched in the "PI3k-Akt signaling pathway".
29954327|ab|14|29954327|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|In addition, a network associated with the TH signaling pathway provides an opportunity to further understand the complex biological processes that occur in metamorphosis.
29954327|ab|15|29954327|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We identified a large number of miRNAs during M. fissipes metamorphosis, and 21 of them were differentially expressed in the two groups that represented two different metamorphic stages.
29954327|ab|16|29954327|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These miRNAs may play important roles during metamorphosis.
29954327|ab|17|29954327|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|The study gives us clues for further studies of the mechanisms of anuran metamorphosis and provides a model to study the mechanism of TH-affected biological processes in humans.
27448213|ab|1|27448213||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Conflicting data is present in the literature about patients who are treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to the exaggeration of the non culprit artery.
27448213|ab|2|27448213||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|The precise understanding of the non culprit artery in the setting of ST segment elevated myocardial infarct (STEMI) is important since the time and modality of the treatment is planned accordingly.
27448213|ab|3|27448213||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study is to evaluate the lesions in the non culprit coronary artery during primary PCI and control coronary angiography (CAG) using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) in multivessel STEMI patients.
27448213|ab|4|27448213||METHODS|METHODS|In this study, multivessel disease STEMI patients whom underwent primary PCI between January 2010 and March 2011 were included.
27448213|ab|5|27448213||METHODS|METHODS|Critical stenosis degree was accepted as >/=70 % in the non culprit artery.
27448213|ab|6|27448213||METHODS|METHODS|All patients were evaluated with control CAG 1 month after primary PCI.
27448213|ab|7|27448213||METHODS|METHODS|Assessment with CAG was performed by two blinded cardiologists.
27448213|ab|8|27448213||RESULTS|METHODS|QCA program was used to evaluate reference artery diameter (RAD), minimum luminal diameter (MLD) and degree of stenosis.
27448213|ab|9|27448213||RESULTS|METHODS|With regard to the degree of stenosis, significant reduction was accepted as >/=15 % while % 5-15 decrease was accepted as moderate.
27448213|ab|10|27448213||RESULTS|RESULTS|Of the 81 patients, 61 were males and 20 were females (mean age 58.1 +/- 10).
27448213|ab|11|27448213||RESULTS|RESULTS|In the control CAG, the degree of non culprit artery stenosis was found to be decreased (p < 0.001) while RAD and MLD were increased (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 respectively).
27448213|ab|12|27448213||RESULTS|RESULTS|Significant decrease in critical non culprit artery lesions was detected in 22 patients (20.9 %) meanwhile moderate reduction was observed in 26 patients (24.7 %).
27448213|ab|13|27448213||RESULTS|RESULTS|In 14 patients (13.3 %), non culprit artery lesions accepted as critical during primary PCI were found to be non critical during the control CAG.
27448213|ab|14|27448213||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Planned intervention was cancelled and medical treatment was initiated in those 14 patients.
27448213|ab|15|27448213||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our data indicated using QCA, approximately the half of non culprit lesions were found less critical during control CAG when compared to primary PCI.
27448213|ab|16|27448213||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Therefore, it is concluded that complete revascularization during primary PCI should be avoided in multivessel STEMI patients and critical non culprit artery lesions should be re-evaluated with later control CAG.
27547850|ab|1|27547850||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Glucose homeostasis depends on the coordinated secretion of glucagon, insulin, and Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 by pancreas and intestine.
27547850|ab|2|27547850||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Obesity, which is associated with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, affects the function of these organs.
27547850|ab|3|27547850||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Here, we investigate the functional and molecular adaptations of proglucagon-producing cells in obese mice to better define their involvement in type 2 diabetes development.
27547850|ab|4|27547850||METHODS|METHODS|We used GLU-Venus transgenic male mice specifically expressing Venus fluorochrome in proglucagon-producing cells.
27547850|ab|5|27547850||RESULTS|METHODS|Mice were subjected to 16 weeks of low-fat diet or high-fat diet (HFD) and then subdivided by measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in 3 groups: low-fat diet mice and I-HFD (glucose-intolerant) mice with similar HbA1c and H-HFD (hyperglycemic) mice, which exhibited higher HbA1c.
27547850|ab|6|27547850||RESULTS|RESULTS|At 16 weeks, both HFD groups exhibited similar weight gain, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance.
27547850|ab|7|27547850||RESULTS|RESULTS|However, I-HFD mice exhibited better glucose tolerance compared with H-HFD mice.
27547850|ab|8|27547850||RESULTS|RESULTS|I-HFD mice displayed functional and molecular adaptations of enteroendocrine L-cells resulting in increased intestinal GLP-1 biosynthesis and release as well as maintained pancreatic alpha- and beta-cell functions.
27547850|ab|9|27547850||RESULTS|RESULTS|By contrast, H-HFD mice exhibited dysfunctional L, alpha- and beta-cells with increased beta- and L-cell numbers.
27547850|ab|10|27547850||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Administration of the GLP-1R antagonist Exendin9-39 in I-HFD mice led to hyperglycemia and alterations of glucagon secretion without changes in insulin secretion.
27547850|ab|11|27547850||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Our results highlight the cross-talk between islet and intestine endocrine cells and indicate that a compensatory adaptation of L-cell function in obesity plays an important role in preserving glucose homeostasis through the control of pancreatic alpha-cell functions.
29787309|ab|1|29787309|RATIONALE|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Patients transferred from the intensive care unit to the wards who are later readmitted to the intensive care unit have increased length of stay, healthcare expenditure, and mortality compared with those who are never readmitted.

29787309|ab|3|29787309|OBJECTIVES|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|We aimed to use a machine-learning technique to derive and validate an intensive care unit readmission prediction model with variables available in the electronic health record in real time and compare it to previously published algorithms.
29787309|ab|4|29787309|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This observational cohort study was conducted at an academic hospital in the United States with approximately 600 inpatient beds.
29787309|ab|5|29787309|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 24,885 intensive care unit transfers to the wards were included, with 14,962 transfers (60%) in the training cohort and 9,923 transfers (40%) in the internal validation cohort.
29787309|ab|6|29787309|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patient characteristics, nursing assessments, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes from prior admissions, medications, intensive care unit interventions, diagnostic tests, vital signs, and laboratory results were extracted from the electronic health record and used as predictor variables in a gradient-boosted machine model.
29787309|ab|7|29787309|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Accuracy for predicting intensive care unit readmission was compared with the Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score and Modified Early Warning Score in the internal validation cohort and also externally using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database (n = 42,303 intensive care unit transfers).
29787309|ab|8|29787309|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Eleven percent (2,834) of discharges to the wards were later readmitted to the intensive care unit.
29787309|ab|9|29787309|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The machine-learning-derived model had significantly better performance (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.76) than either the Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.65), or Modified Early Warning Score (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.58; P value < 0.0001 for all comparisons).
29787309|ab|10|29787309|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|At a specificity of 95%, the derived model had a sensitivity of 28% compared with 15% for Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score and 7% for the Modified Early Warning Score.

29775513|ab|2|29775513|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Nurses are frequently interrupted during medicine administration.
29775513|ab|3|29775513|BACKGROUND|METHODS|BACKGROUND|There is no systematic description of nurses' behaviours and interruptions during administration of medicines to patients.
29775513|ab|4|29775513|DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|Exploratory nonparticipant observational study.
29775513|ab|5|29775513|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Three hundred and fifty-one episodes of medicine administration with 32 nurses from three hospitals in Norway were observed using paper-based observation grids between December 2013 and March 2014.
29775513|ab|6|29775513|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Nurses were frequently interrupted and distracted, mainly by nurses and other healthcare professionals.
29775513|ab|7|29775513|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|One-third of the nurses interrupted their medicine administration: They prioritised helping patients with direct patient care.
29775513|ab|8|29775513|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|When the nurses were interrupted, they left the round and re-entered the procedure.
29775513|ab|9|29775513|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Even so, they managed to refocus and continue to administer the medicines: Interruptions and disturbances made little difference to most behaviours and actions, possibly because nurses double-checked more frequently.
29775513|ab|10|29775513|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Some differences were seen in behaviours potentially affecting the safety of the medicine administration, such as leaving medicines at the bedside and not helping patients take their medicines.

29775513|ab|16|29775513|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Our data indicate that nurses and other healthcare professionals should be warned not to interrupt colleague administering medicines and managers should ensure other staff are available to respond to patients' immediate needs during medicine rounds.
29806673|ab|1|29806673|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness (RCC) using maximal or peak oxygen consumption (VO2), requires a high level of effort in obese patients.
29806673|ab|2|29806673|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|We propose a method to evaluate RCC using constant and moderate loads, called VO2 kinetics (tau).
29806673|ab|3|29806673|AIM|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|To determine the relationship between tau and peak VO2 in patients with obesity.
29806673|ab|4|29806673|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Forty patients (87% females) aged 37 +/- 12 years and with a body mass index (BMI) of 34.6 +/- 4.0 kg/m2, were divided into two groups according to the applied workload (0.5 and 0.8 Watts/kg body mass) using a cycle ergometer and Cortex Metalyzer 3b equipment.
29806673|ab|5|29806673|MATERIAL AND METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|The protocol was started with 6 minutes at constant load and then increments of 20-25 Watts every two min were made until determination of the peak VO2.
29806673|ab|6|29806673|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The tau value was 51.8 +/- 17.6 s, the absolute peak VO2 was 2.0 +/- 0.7 L/min and the relative peak VO2 was 26.6 +/- 30.0 ml/kg/min.
29806673|ab|7|29806673|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|There was a significant difference of tau medians between the group that used 0.5 and 0.8 Watts/kg (p = 0.002) and a significant inverse correlation between the absolute peak VO2 and the tau value for a load of 0.5 Watts/kg (rho = -0.415, p = 0.0327).
29806673|ab|8|29806673|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The higher tau value, the lower the peak VO2 of an obese patient.
29806673|ab|9|29806673|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|It is suggested to apply loads of 0.5 Watts/kg for a VO2 kinetics test in obese patients or in subjects who do not wish to carry out higher physiological demands with a non-invasive and low risk procedure.

27334749|ab|2|27334749||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|We previously showed in C57BL/6 mice that part of the CD4(+) T-cell repertoire specific for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 also recognizes the neuronal antigen neurofilament medium (NF-M) 15-35.
27334749|ab|3|27334749||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|Such bi-specific CD4(+) T cells are frequent and produce inflammatory cytokines after stimulation.
27334749|ab|4|27334749||RESULTS|RESULTS|Since T cells recognizing two self-antigens would be expected to be tolerized more efficiently, this finding prompted us to study how polyspecificity impacts tolerance.
27334749|ab|5|27334749||RESULTS|RESULTS|We found that similar to MOG, NF-M is expressed in the thymus by medullary thymic epithelial cells, a tolerogenic population.
27334749|ab|6|27334749||RESULTS|RESULTS|Nevertheless, the frequency, phenotype, and capacity to transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) of MOG35-55 -reactive CD4(+) T cells were increased in MOG-deficient but not in NF-M-deficient mice.
27334749|ab|7|27334749||RESULTS|RESULTS|We found that presentation of NF-M15-35 by I-A(b) on dendritic cells is of short duration, suggesting unstable MHC class II binding.
27334749|ab|8|27334749||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Consistently, introducing an MHC-anchoring residue into NF-M15-35 (NF-M15-35 T20Y) increased its immunogenicity, activating a repertoire able to induce EAE.
27334749|ab|9|27334749||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Our results show that in C57BL/6 mice bi-specific encephalitogenic T cells manage to escape tolerization due to inefficient exposure to two self-antigens.
29952980|ab|1|29952980|BACKGROUND|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dry needling (DN) for treating low back pain (LBP).
29952980|ab|2|29952980|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Nine databases were searched from inception to October 2017.
29952980|ab|3|29952980|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving DN for treating LBP were retrieved.
29952980|ab|4|29952980|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Two reviewers independently screened the articles, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias among the included studies using the risk of bias assessment tool by Cochrane Collaboration.
29952980|ab|5|29952980|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Sixteen RCTs were included and the risk of bias assessment of them was "high" or "unclear" for most domains.
29952980|ab|6|29952980|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Meta-analysis results suggested that DN was more effective than acupuncture in alleviating pain intensity and functional disability at postintervention, while its efficacy on pain and disability at follow-up was only equal to acupuncture.
29952980|ab|7|29952980|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Besides, DN was superior to sham needling for alleviating pain intensity at postintervention/follow-up and functional disability at postintervention.
29952980|ab|8|29952980|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Additionally, qualitative review revealed that DN combined with acupuncture had more significant effect on alleviating pain intensity at postintervention and achieved higher response rate than DN alone.
29952980|ab|9|29952980|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|However, compared with other treatments (laser, physical therapy, other combined treatments, etc.), it remained uncertain whether the efficacy of DN was superior or equal because the results of included studies were mixed.
29952980|ab|10|29952980|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Compared with acupuncture and sham needling, DN is more effective for alleviating pain and disability at postintervention in LBP, while its effectiveness on pain and disability at follow-up was equal to acupuncture.
29952980|ab|11|29952980|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Besides, it remains uncertain whether the efficacy of DN is superior to other treatments.
29952980|ab|12|29952980|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Nevertheless, considering the overall "high" or "unclear" risk of bias of studies, all current evidence is not robust to draw a firm conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of DN for LBP.
29952980|ab|13|29952980|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Future RCTs with rigorous methodologies are required to confirm our findings.
29952980|ab|14|29952980|CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|NONE|DETAILS OF  No ethical approval was required for this systematic review and meta-analysis.
29957482|ab|1|29957482|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Bipolar Disorder (BD) presents in 1-4% of the world's population, carrying significant financial and functional consequences.
29957482|ab|2|29957482|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Beyond the direct disease burden, patients with BD experience a high degree of both internal and external stigma.
29957482|ab|3|29957482|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Additionally, medication adherence tends to be poor in patients with BD.
29957482|ab|4|29957482|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Knowledge appears to play a role in mitigating both stigma and non-adherence, but these relationships have not been fully elucidated.
29957482|ab|5|29957482|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|The Bipolar Disorder Knowledge Scale (BDKS) was designed to explore the role of knowledge and better define such relationships.
29957482|ab|6|29957482|PURPOSE|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|This research provides the evidence for the reliability and validity of the scale.
29957482|ab|7|29957482|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Forty-seven items were developed to assess knowledge of BD.
29957482|ab|8|29957482|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The 47-item survey was sent out to two groups: first a group of 43 pharmacists with BCPP credentials from the College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists (CPNP) who were recruited from the CPNP directory, and second a group of 250 members of the general public who were recruited using Qualtrics Online Sample service.
29957482|ab|9|29957482|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Participants were surveyed on their education status, health literacy, BD diagnostic status, and exposure to patients with BD.
29957482|ab|10|29957482|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Participants then completed the 47-item scale.
29957482|ab|11|29957482|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|After 48 h 100 members from the original general public group were sent the same survey to assess test-retest reliability.
29957482|ab|12|29957482|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|For each item a difficulty index to evaluate how well participants performed on the item and a discrimination index to determine how well each item performed in high-scorers versus low scorers were calculated.
29957482|ab|13|29957482|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Additionally, Cronbach's alpha was calculated to determine internal consistency validity and a Pearson correlation was run to determine test-retest reliability.
29957482|ab|14|29957482|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Items were removed based on the results from the difficulty index, discrimination index, and Cronbach's alpha.
29957482|ab|15|29957482|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Finally the pharmacist final scores were compared to the general public using an unpaired t-test to assess whether content experts were more likely to perform better on the scale.
29957482|ab|16|29957482|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Following item removal, the scale was finalized at 25-items.
29957482|ab|17|29957482|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean score for the scale was 34.48 (71.83%; SD: 5.50) and the Cronbach's alpha was 0.773 before item analysis.
29957482|ab|18|29957482|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Following item analysis, 22 items were dropped leaving 25 items on the final version of the scale.
29957482|ab|19|29957482|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The remaining items retained a difficulty index below 90% and a discrimination index above 20%.
29957482|ab|20|29957482|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean of the 25-item scale was 18.40 (73.6%; SD: 4.13) for the general public and 23.20 (92.8%; SD: 1.36) for the pharmacists group (p<0.001).
29957482|ab|21|29957482|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The Cronbach's alpha for the finalized scale was 0.760, indicating a high-degree of internal consistency.
29957482|ab|22|29957482|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|While this is lower than the original alpha, this may be explained by the reduced number of scale items.
29957482|ab|23|29957482|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A 25-item scale is much more practical and the items on the scale retain stronger item analysis statistics.
29957482|ab|24|29957482|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Finally, the Pearson Correlation for the group who underwent the test-retest procedure was 0.841 (p<0.001) indicating strong test-retest reliability.
29957482|ab|25|29957482|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The BDKS is a 25-item true-false scale that takes approximately 5-10 min to complete.
29957482|ab|26|29957482|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The scale assesses knowledge of BD with items targeting diagnosis, etiology, disease course, symptoms, treatment, and life impact.
29957482|ab|27|29957482|CONCLUSION|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|The scale has shown strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability in a general population and will be useful for evaluating knowledge of BD as it relates to stigma, non-adherence, and other variables.
29056341|ab|1|29056341||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|CLYBL encodes a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial enzyme, conserved across all vertebrates, whose cellular activity and pathway assignment are unknown.
29056341|ab|2|29056341||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Its homozygous loss is tolerated in seemingly healthy individuals, with reduced circulating B12 levels being the only and consistent phenotype reported to date.
29056341|ab|3|29056341||RESULTS|RESULTS|Here, by combining enzymology, structural biology, and activity-based metabolomics, we report that CLYBL operates as a citramalyl-CoA lyase in mammalian cells.
29056341|ab|4|29056341||RESULTS|RESULTS|Cells lacking CLYBL accumulate citramalyl-CoA, an intermediate in the C5-dicarboxylate metabolic pathway that includes itaconate, a recently identified human anti-microbial metabolite and immunomodulator.
29056341|ab|5|29056341||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|We report that CLYBL loss leads to a cell-autonomous defect in the mitochondrial B12 metabolism and that itaconyl-CoA is a cofactor-inactivating, substrate-analog inhibitor of the mitochondrial B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT).
29056341|ab|6|29056341||BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Our work de-orphans the function of human CLYBL and reveals that a consequence of exposure to the immunomodulatory metabolite itaconate is B12 inactivation.
29791419|ab|1|29791419|INTRODUCTION|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|The incidental detection of rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NET) has increased but there is no proper consensus about treatment.
29791419|ab|2|29791419|OBJECTIVE|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic treatment for rectal NET less than 20 mm, with emphasis in "standardized treatment".
29791419|ab|3|29791419|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|From January 2012 to April 2016, we included patients with rectal NET less than 20 mm resected by conventional EMR, EMR-B and ESD.
29791419|ab|4|29791419|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We considered as "standardized treatment" the one that has precise indication and technical rigor (EMR-B for lesions </= 10 mm and ESD for lesions between 11 and 20 mm).
29791419|ab|5|29791419|MATERIAL AND METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|We evaluate complete resection rates and incidence of complications.
29791419|ab|6|29791419|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|23 patients with 23 rectal NET were included.
29791419|ab|7|29791419|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean age was 52.96 +/- 12.44 years.
29791419|ab|8|29791419|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean tumor diameter was 8.8 +/- 3.4 mm.
29791419|ab|9|29791419|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The complete resection rates by conventional EMR, EMR-Band ESD were 50 (3/6), 92.8 (13/14) and 100% (3/3), respectively; while by standardized and conventional treatment were 100 (14/14) and 55.5% (5/9), respectively.
29791419|ab|10|29791419|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Complications occurred in 4 cases (17.4%), bleeding in 2 and perforation in 2, all of them solved by endoscopy.
29791419|ab|11|29791419|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Endoscopic treatment by EMR-B and ESD is efficacious and safe for rectal NET </= 20 mm.
29791419|ab|12|29791419|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|Standardized treatment improve the efficacy of endoscopic treatment.
29952997|ab|1|29952997|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The aim of the study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of epidural analgesia and transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block.
29952997|ab|2|29952997|BACKGROUND|METHODS|BACKGROUND|TAP block has gained popularity to provide postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery but its advantage over epidural analgesia is disputed.
29952997|ab|3|29952997|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines.
29952997|ab|4|29952997|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Only trials comparing TAP block with epidural analgesia were included.
29952997|ab|5|29952997|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The primary outcome was pain score at rest (analog scale, 0-10) on postoperative day 1 analyzed in subgroups according to the population (children and adults).
29952997|ab|6|29952997|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|Secondary outcomes included rate of hypotension, length of stay, and functional outcomes (time to first bowel sound, time to first flatus).
29952997|ab|7|29952997|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Ten controlled trials, including 505 patients (195 children and 310 adults), were identified.
29952997|ab|8|29952997|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Pain scores at rest on postoperative day 1 were equivalent for TAP block and epidural analgesia groups in children (mean difference: 0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.1 to 0.6; I = 0%; P = .15) and in adults (mean difference: 0.5; 95% CI: -0.1 to 1.0; I = 81%; P = .10).
29952997|ab|9|29952997|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The quality of evidence for our primary outcome was moderate according to the GRADE system.
29952997|ab|10|29952997|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The epidural analgesia group experienced a higher rate of hypotension (relative risk: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.04-0.38; I = 0%; P = .0002), while hospital length of stay was shorter in the TAP block group (mean difference: -0.6 days; 95% CI: -0.9 to -0.3 days; I = 0%; P < .0001), without impact on functional outcomes.
29952997|ab|11|29952997|CONCLUSION|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|There is moderate evidence that TAP block and epidural analgesia are equally effective in treating postoperative pain in both pediatric and adult patients, while TAP block is associated with fewer episodes of hypotension and reduced length of stay.
29796612|ab|1|29796612|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The management of medically refractory epilepsy patients who are not surgical candidates has remained challenging.
29796612|ab|2|29796612|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Closed loop-or responsive-neurostimulation (RNS) is now an established therapy for the treatment of epilepsy with specific indications.
29796612|ab|3|29796612|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The RNS(R) system (NeuroPace Inc, Mountainview, California) has recently been shown to be effective in reducing the seizure frequency of partial onset seizures.
29796612|ab|4|29796612|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The electrode design consists of either intracerebral depth electrodes or subdural strip electrodes, and stereotaxis is typically used to guide placement into the EZ.
29796612|ab|5|29796612|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Details on the operative techniques used to place these electrodes have been lacking.
29796612|ab|6|29796612|OBJECTIVE|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|To address the advantage of using a robotic-assisted technique to place depth electrodes for RNS(R) system placement compared to the typical frame-based or frameless stereotactic systems.
29796612|ab|7|29796612|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|We retrospectively reviewed our single center, technical operative experience with RNS(R) system placement using robotic assistance from 2014 to 2016 via chart review.
29796612|ab|8|29796612|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Twelve patients underwent RNS(R) system placement using robotic assistance.
29796612|ab|9|29796612|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean operative time was 121 min for a median of 2 depth electrodes with mean deviation from intended target of approximately 3 mm in x, y, and z planes.
29796612|ab|10|29796612|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Two patients developed wound infections, 1 of whom was reimplanted.
29796612|ab|11|29796612|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Seizures were reduced by approximately 40% at 2 yr, similar to the results seen in the open label portion of the pivotal RNS trial.

29952808|ab|1|29952808|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study aimed to analyze the isolated role of unsupported arm activities and the physiological responses and dynamic hyperinflation (DH) induced by activities of daily living in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
29952808|ab|2|29952808|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|METHODS|Physiological responses and DH were compared using the Glittre activities of daily living test (TGlittre) and a modified protocol that emphasized unsupported arm activities and excluded squats and bending down to move objects on shelves (TGlittre-M).
29952808|ab|3|29952808|PURPOSE|METHODS|METHODS|Data were also compared from the isolated shelf tasks of TGlittre (TSHELF) and TGlittre-M (TSHELF-M).
29952808|ab|4|29952808|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This cross-sectional study included 30 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who performed the TGlittre, TGlittre-M, TSHELF and TSHELF-M.
29952808|ab|5|29952808|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|The physiological responses were evaluated during the 4 protocols and inspiratory capacity was measured before and immediately after the tests for evaluation of DH.
29952808|ab|6|29952808|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Patients had higher oxygen uptake, ventilatory demand, dyspnea, and DH in the TGlittre than in the TGlittre-M (mean differences: 123 +/- 119 mL/min; 0.11 +/- 0.10, 1 [-1 to 3], and - 0.14 +/- 0.22, respectively; P < .05 for all).
29952808|ab|7|29952808|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Oxygen uptake, ventilatory demand, and dyspnea were also higher in the TSHELF than in the TSHELF-M (mean differences: 408 +/- 185 mL/min; 0.26 +/- 0.17; 1 [-1 to 3], respectively; P < .05 for all).
29952808|ab|8|29952808|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|However, DH was similar for both tasks (P > .05).
29952808|ab|9|29952808|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the physiological demands during unsupported arm activities were lower than during the task performed with squatting and bending down; however, the magnitude of DH did not differ between them.
29952808|ab|10|29952808|CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|CONCLUSIONS|These results suggest that the isolated arm activities contribute less to the TGlittre's physiological requirement than the lower-limb and trunk activities.
29776700|ab|1|29776700|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|A troponin assay is commonly sent for patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
29776700|ab|2|29776700|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Multiple studies suggest that elevated troponin levels do not predict coronary artery disease in these patients.
29776700|ab|3|29776700|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Patients with elevated troponins are more likely to have additional cardiac testing, which can lead to increased health care costs and unnecessary invasive procedures.
29776700|ab|4|29776700|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Our objective was to evaluate low- to intermediate-risk patients (HEART [history, electrocardiography, age, risk factors and troponin] Score 1-6) presenting to the ED with SVT.
29776700|ab|5|29776700|OBJECTIVE|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Our hypothesis was that an elevated troponin would not predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE), but would be associated with increased hospital admission rates and lengths of stay.
29776700|ab|6|29776700|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who presented with SVT to a large, urban, academic hospital ED over 4 years who had a troponin result.
29776700|ab|7|29776700|METHODS|RESULTS|METHODS|A total of 46 patients were included in the study.
29776700|ab|8|29776700|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Patients with a positive troponin (>0.05 ng/mL) had a hospital admission rate of 86% versus 21% for patients with negative troponin (p = 0.006); rate of cardiology consult of 86% versus 21% (p < 0.001); and a mean total length of stay of 4157 min versus 1347 min (p = 0.04).
29776700|ab|9|29776700|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|At 3 months, none of the patients with a positive troponin had an MACE, death from any cause, or positive results of cardiac testing.
29776700|ab|10|29776700|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Patients with a positive troponin result had significantly more admissions, cardiology consults, and longer hospital stays.
29776700|ab|11|29776700|CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|CONCLUSIONS|These patients did not have an increased prevalence of MACE.
29781847|ab|1|29781847|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|To identify the critical nontechnical skills (NTS) required for high performance in variable-resource contexts (VRC).
29781847|ab|2|29781847|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|As surgical training and capacity increase in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), new strategies for improving surgical education and care in these settings are required.
29781847|ab|3|29781847|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|NTS are critical for high performance in surgery around the world.
29781847|ab|4|29781847|BACKGROUND|METHODS|BACKGROUND|However, the essential NTS used by surgeons operating in LMICs to overcome the challenges specific to their contexts have never been described.
29781847|ab|5|29781847|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, 52 intraoperative team observations as well as 34 critical incident interviews with surgical providers (surgeons, anesthetists, and nurses) were performed at the 4 tertiary referral hospitals in Rwanda.
29781847|ab|6|29781847|METHOD|RESULTS|METHODS|Interview transcripts and field notes from observations were analyzed using line-by-line coding to identify emerging themes until thematic saturation was achieved.
29781847|ab|7|29781847|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Four skill categories of situation awareness, decision-making, communication/teamwork, and leadership emerged.
29781847|ab|8|29781847|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|This provided the framework for a contextually informed skills taxonomy consisting of 12 skill elements with examples of specific behaviors indicative of high performance.
29781847|ab|9|29781847|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|While the main skill categories were consistent with those encountered in high-income countries, the specific behaviors associated with these skills often focused on overcoming the frequently encountered variability in resources, staff, systems support, and language in this context.
29781847|ab|10|29781847|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This is the first description of the critical nontechnical skills, and associated example behaviors, used by surgeons in a VRC to overcome common challenges to safe and effective surgical patient care.
29781847|ab|11|29781847|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Improvements in the NTS used by surgeons operating in VRCs have the potential to improve surgical care delivery worldwide.
