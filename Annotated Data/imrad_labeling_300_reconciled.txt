29958222|ab|1|29958222|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The aepEXplus monitoring system, which uses mid-latency auditory evoked potentials to measure depth of hypnosis, was evaluated in pediatric patients receiving desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia.
29958222|ab|2|29958222|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Seventy-five patients, 1-18 years of age (stratified for age; 1-3, 3-6, 6-18 years, for subgroup analyses), were included in this prospective observational study.
29958222|ab|3|29958222|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The aepEX and the bispectral index (BIS) were recorded simultaneously, the latter serving as a reference.
29958222|ab|4|29958222|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The ability of the aepEX to detect different levels of consciousness, defined according to the University of Michigan Sedation Scale, investigated using prediction probability (Pk), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, served as the primary outcome parameter.
29958222|ab|5|29958222|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|As a secondary outcome parameter, the relationship between end-tidal desflurane and the aepEX and BIS values were calculated by fitting in a nonlinear regression model.
29958222|ab|6|29958222|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The Pk values for the aepEX and the BIS were, respectively, .68 (95% CI, 0.53-0.82) and .85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96; P = .02).
29958222|ab|7|29958222|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The aepEX and the BIS had an area under the ROC curve of, respectively, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80-0.95) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68-0.84; P = .04).
29958222|ab|8|29958222|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The maximized sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 81% (95% CI, 61%-93%) and 86% (95% CI, 74%-94%) for the aepEX at a cutoff value of >52, and 69% (95% CI, 56%-81%) and 70% (95% CI, 57%-81%) for the BIS at a cutoff value of >65.
29958222|ab|9|29958222|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The age-corrected end-tidal desflurane concentration associated with an index value of 50 (EC50) was 0.59 minimum alveolar concentration (interquartile range: 0.38-0.85) and 0.58 minimum alveolar concentration (interquartile range: 0.41-0.70) for, respectively, the aepEX and BIS (P = .69).
29958222|ab|10|29958222|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Age-group analysis showed no evidence of a difference regarding the area under the ROC curve or EC50.
29958222|ab|11|29958222|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The aepEX can reliably differentiate between a conscious and an unconscious state in pediatric patients receiving desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia.
29950143|ab|1|29950143|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Bone-regulating hormones and nutrients play an important role in influencing metabolic health.
29950143|ab|2|29950143|AIM|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to determine whether bone-regulating hormones and nutrients, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), and magnesium (Mg) could be used to characterize the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) phenotype.
29950143|ab|3|29950143|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This study included 27 overweight or obese participants (14 men/13 women) classified as MHO ( n = 14) or metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) ( n = 13) based on the presence or absence of metabolic abnormalities, determined by percentage body fat, percentage trunk fat, and waist circumference.
29950143|ab|4|29950143|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Biochemical (serum concentrations of hormones and cytokines such as PTH, 25OHD, ionized Mg (iMg), cytokines, lipids, glycemic indices), physiological (percentage body fat, percentage trunk fat, blood pressure (BP)), and dietary intake (Mg intake, calcium intake) measurements were obtained.
29950143|ab|5|29950143|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Serum PTH concentrations were significantly lower ( p = 0.005) in the MHO group (39.68 +/- 11.06 pg/mL) compared with the MUO group (63.78 +/- 25.82 pg/mL).
29950143|ab|6|29950143|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Serum iMg concentrations were higher ( p = 0.052) in the MHO group (0.565 +/- 0.41 mmol/L) than in the MUO group (0.528 +/- 0.050 mmol/L).
29950143|ab|7|29950143|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Serum concentrations of osteocalcin were also higher (10.37 +/- 3.70 ng/mL) in the MHO compared with the MUO (6.51 +/- 4.14 ng/mL) group ( p = 0.017).
29950143|ab|8|29950143|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The MHO group had significantly lower serum insulin concentrations ( p = 0.006) and diastolic BP ( p = 0.035).
29950143|ab|9|29950143|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Concentrations of serum 25OHD, total triglycerides, C-reactive protein and systolic BP did not differ between groups.
29950143|ab|10|29950143|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings suggest that bone-regulating hormones and nutrients, especially serum PTH, osteocalcin concentrations, and dietary Mg intakes, can help to characterize the MHO phenotype.

29949784|ab|2|29949784|BACKGROUND/AIMS|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in multiple cellular processes, including oncogenesis, and miR-592 itself participates in many malignancies; however, its role in GC remains unknown.
29949784|ab|3|29949784|BACKGROUND/AIMS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In this study, we investigated the expression and molecular mechanisms of miR-592 in GC.
29949784|ab|4|29949784|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the expression of miR-592 and its putative targets in human tissues and cell lines.
29949784|ab|5|29949784|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8, population doubling time, colony formation, Transwell, and wound-healing assays in transfected GC cells in vitro.
29949784|ab|6|29949784|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine whether miR-592 could directly bind its target.
29949784|ab|7|29949784|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A tumorigenesis assay was used to study whether miR-592 affected GC growth in vivo.
29949784|ab|8|29949784|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Proteins involved in signaling pathways and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were detected with western blot.
29949784|ab|9|29949784|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The ectopic expression of miR-592 promoted GC proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and facilitated tumorigenesis in vivo.
29949784|ab|10|29949784|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Spry2 was a direct target of miR-592 and Spry2 overexpression partially counteracted the effects of miR-592.
29949784|ab|11|29949784|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|miR-592 induced the EMT and promoted its progression in GC via the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways by inhibiting Spry2.
29949784|ab|12|29949784|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Overexpression of miR-592 promotes GC proliferation, migration, and invasion and induces the EMT via the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways by inhibiting Spry2, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for GC.
20211270|ab|1|20211270||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Regularity of laminar origin and termination of projections appears to be a common feature of corticocortical connections.
20211270|ab|2|20211270||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We tested three models of this regularity, originally formulated for primate cerebral cortex, using quantitative data on the relative supragranular layer origins (SGN%) of 151 projections from 19 areas ( approximately 145,000 neurons) to four areas of cat extrastriate cortex.
20211270|ab|3|20211270||METHODS|METHODS|Predictive variables in the models were: hierarchical level differences (Barone et al., 2000), structural type differences (Barbas, 1986), and distances (Salin and Bullier, 1995) between areas.
20211270|ab|4|20211270||METHODS|METHODS|Global and local hierarchies of cat visual cortex were used to evaluate the hierarchical model.
20211270|ab|5|20211270||METHODS|METHODS|Ranking of areas by their cytoarchitectural differentiation (e.g., relative prominence of layer IV) allowed testing of the structural model, while the distance model was tested for the number of borders separating areas.
20211270|ab|6|20211270||RESULTS|RESULTS|Laminar projection origins correlated moderately with hierarchical differences, and poorly with border distances, but were strongly and consistently correlated with area differences in cytoarchitectural rank.
20211270|ab|7|20211270||RESULTS|RESULTS|Moreover, projection densities were moderately and negatively correlated with area distances and structural differences.
20211270|ab|8|20211270||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our findings suggest that the relative cytoarchitectural differentiation of cortical areas is the main determinant of laminar projection origins in cat visual cortex, and may underlie a general laminar regularity of mammalian cortical connections.
29954372|ab|1|29954372|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Despite the growing interest in developing markers for predicting treatment response and optimizing treatment decisions, an appropriate methodology to identify, combine and evaluate such markers has been slow to develop.
29954372|ab|2|29954372|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We propose a step-by-step strategy for analysing data from existing randomised trials with the aim of identifying a multi-marker model for guiding decisions about treatment.
29954372|ab|3|29954372|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We start with formulating the treatment selection problem, continue with defining the treatment threshold, prepare a list of candidate markers, develop the model, apply the model to estimate individual treatment effects, and evaluate model performance in the study group of patients who meet the trial eligibility criteria.
29954372|ab|4|29954372|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In this process, we rely on some well-known techniques for multivariable prediction modelling, but focus on predicting benefit from treatment, rather than outcome itself.
29954372|ab|5|29954372|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We present our approach using data from a randomised trial in which 808 women with multiple pregnancy were assigned to cervical pessary or control, to prevent adverse perinatal outcomes.
29954372|ab|6|29954372|METHODS|METHODS|RESULTS|Overall, cervical pessary did not reduce the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.
29954372|ab|7|29954372|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The treatment threshold was zero.
29954372|ab|8|29954372|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We had a preselected list of 5 potential markers and developed a logistic model including the markers, treatment and all marker-by-treatment interaction terms.
29954372|ab|9|29954372|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The model was well calibrated and identified 35% (95% confidence interval (CI) 32 to 39%) of the trial participants as benefitting from pessary insertion.
29954372|ab|10|29954372|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We estimated that the risk of adverse outcome could be reduced from 13.5 to 8.1% (5.4% risk reduction; 95% CI 2.1 to 8.6%) through model-based selective pessary insertion.
29954372|ab|11|29954372|RESULTS|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|The next step is external validation upon existence of independent trial data.
29954372|ab|12|29954372|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We suggest revisiting existing trials data to explore whether differences in treatment benefit can be explained by differences in baseline characteristics of patients.
29954372|ab|13|29954372|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This could lead to treatment selection tools which, after validation in comparable existing trials, can be introduced into clinical practice for guiding treatment decisions in future patients.
18657335|ab|1|18657335||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Diabetes mellitus is the most common chronic metabolic disease.
18657335|ab|2|18657335||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The raising diabetes epidemic is unfolding as an interaction between several environmental factors and a genetic predisposition.
18657335|ab|3|18657335||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the PPARgamma-Pro12Ala and ENPP1-K121Q polymorphisms on type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in a case-control study in the Tunisian population.
18657335|ab|4|18657335||METHODS|METHODS|To assess for any association of ENPP1-K121Q and PPARgamma-Pro12Ala polymorphisms with T2D risk, we analysed the genotypic and allelic distributions of each variant in the studied cohort.
18657335|ab|5|18657335||RESULTS|RESULTS|Our results support that the genetic variation at ENPP1-K121Q predisposes to T2D in the Tunisian population after adjustment on gender, age and BMI status (OR=1.55, 95%CI [1.11-2.16], p=0.007).
18657335|ab|6|18657335||RESULTS|RESULTS|Conversely, the PPARgamma-Pro12Ala variant seems not to have a significant effect on T2D risk in our Tunisian cohort.
18657335|ab|7|18657335||RESULTS|RESULTS|However, the minor A-allele would convey protection against overweight in the Tunisian population.
18657335|ab|8|18657335||RESULTS|RESULTS|In fact, the over weighted subjects showed a significantly lower frequency of A-allele than lean controls (OR=0.49, 95%CI [0.25-0.97], p=0.02).
18657335|ab|9|18657335||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that ENPP1-121Q is involved in the genetic susceptibility of T2D in the Tunisian population, while the PPARgamma-12Ala allele may confer protection against overweight.
29953830|ab|1|29953830|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This systematic review aimed to synthesize the effects of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to improve performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) in community-dwelling older adults.
29953830|ab|2|29953830|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|Searches were conducted in CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and OTseeker.
29953830|ab|3|29953830|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|Empirical studies published between 1995 and 2015 were individually screened and appraised by two reviewers.
29953830|ab|4|29953830|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Forty-three studies met the review inclusion and exclusion criteria.
29953830|ab|5|29953830|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Physical exercise was the most common intervention approach.
29953830|ab|6|29953830|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Physical exercise interventions for frail older adults showed a moderate benefit, but no benefits were found for older adults without noticeable difficulty in ADLs.
29953830|ab|7|29953830|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|For older adults with difficulty in ADLs, there was a high benefit of using home-based intervention.
29953830|ab|8|29953830|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The findings of this systematic review highlight the importance of addressing older adults' living environment in intervention to promote independence in ADLs.
22994439|ab|1|22994439||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The prevalence of heart failure (HF) in the population is increasing, concomitant with high incidence of rehospitalizations and mortality.
22994439|ab|2|22994439||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to characterize a prognostic risk score model for patients with chronic HF.
22994439|ab|3|22994439||METHODS|METHODS|A total of 500 patients followed at the HF clinic were evaluated by clinical, functional, laboratory, imaging, and therapeutic variables that were correlated to mortality during a follow-up period of 25 months.
22994439|ab|4|22994439||METHODS|METHODS|Risk stratification was carried out by applying a risk score model based on multivariate analysis.
22994439|ab|5|22994439||RESULTS|RESULTS|Predictors correlated with mortality during follow-up were systolic blood pressure <110 mm Hg, male sex, age older than 70 years, 6-minute walk distance <300 m, lack of beta-blocker therapy, hyperuricemia (>7.5 mg/dL), hyponatremia, and prolonged QTc interval (>450 ms).
22994439|ab|6|22994439||RESULTS|RESULTS|Based on these variables, a risk score model (score 0-55) was established and included low risk, score <21 (9% mortality during 2-year follow-up); moderate risk, 21 to 29 (22%); high risk, 30 to 35 (35%), and very high risk: >=36 points (62% 2-year mortality).
22994439|ab|7|22994439||RESULTS|RESULTS|The risk model had good discrimination ability (concordance index 0.75), which was better than the performance of the Seattle Heart Failure Model on our cohort (0.69).
22994439|ab|8|22994439||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Simple noninvasive characteristics examined during the initial admission to the HF clinic can serve as prognostic markers for mortality and may help in the process of therapeutic decision-making in patients with HF.
29957254|ab|1|29957254|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Extracellular high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been identified as playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis.
29957254|ab|2|29957254|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, the underlying mechanism of its involvement in cardiac fibrosis is still not well-defined.
29957254|ab|3|29957254|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|Here, we aim to investigate whether toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) contributes to the extracellular HMGB1-mediated development and progression of cardiac fibrosis.
29957254|ab|4|29957254|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A mouse model of cardiac fibrosis was induced by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (ISO).
29957254|ab|5|29957254|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), an inhibitor of HMGB1 derived from natural products, was simultaneously administered by intraperitoneal injection.
29957254|ab|6|29957254|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Echocardiography, H&E and Sirius red staining were used to evaluate cardiac function and fibrosis.
29957254|ab|7|29957254|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The myocardial expression of autophagy-associated proteins was examined using immunoblotting.
29957254|ab|8|29957254|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Cardiac fibroblasts were treated with different concentrations of HMGB1 to examine the expression levels of alpha-SMA, collagen I and autophagy markers.
29957254|ab|9|29957254|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Interactions of HMGB1/TLR2 and alpha-SMA/p62 were examined by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence.
29957254|ab|10|29957254|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|ISO-treated mice showed characteristic cardiac fibrosis, increased expression and co-localization of HMGB1 and TLR2, as well as impaired autophagic signals in myocardial tissues, which could be prevented by silencing TLR2.
29957254|ab|11|29957254|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Exogenous administration of HMGB1 blocked the autophagic flux in fibroblasts, which caused extensive accumulation of collagen I and alpha-SMA.
29957254|ab|12|29957254|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, cardiac fibrosis was alleviated by GA treatment through abrogating the interaction between HMGB1 and TLR2.
29957254|ab|13|29957254|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our study suggests that the interaction between TLR2 and HMGB1 contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis via suppressing fibroblast autophagy, and that inhibiting HMGB1 with GA provides therapeutic benefits for the treatment of fibroproliferative heart diseases.
26972210|ab|1|26972210||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The present guidelines on dermatomyositis (DM) represent an excerpt from the interdisciplinary S2k guidelines on myositis syndromes of the German Society of Neurology (available at www.awmf.org).
26972210|ab|2|26972210||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The cardinal symptom of myositis in DM is symmetrical proximal muscle weakness.
26972210|ab|3|26972210||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Elevated creatine kinase, CRP or ESR as well as electromyography and muscle biopsy also provide important diagnostic clues.
26972210|ab|4|26972210||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Pharyngeal, respiratory, cardiac, and neck muscles may also be affected.
26972210|ab|5|26972210||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Given that approximately 30 % of patients also develop interstitial lung disease, pulmonary function tests should be part of the diagnostic workup.
26972210|ab|6|26972210||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Although the cutaneous manifestations in DM are variable, taken together, they represent a characteristic and crucial diagnostic criterion for DM.
26972210|ab|7|26972210||RESULTS|RESULTS|Approximately 5-20 % of individuals exhibit typical skin lesions without any clinically manifest muscle involvement (amyopathic DM).
26972210|ab|8|26972210||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|About 30 % of adult DM cases are associated with a malignancy.
26972210|ab|9|26972210||RESULTS|RESULTS|This fact, however, should not delay the treatment of severe myositis.
26972210|ab|10|26972210||RESULTS|RESULTS|Corticosteroids are the therapy of choice in myositis (1-2 mg/kg).
26972210|ab|11|26972210||RESULTS|RESULTS|Additional immunosuppressive therapy is frequently required (azathioprine, for children methotrexate).
26972210|ab|12|26972210||RESULTS|RESULTS|In case of insufficient therapeutic response, the use of intravenous immunoglobulins is justified.
26972210|ab|13|26972210||RESULTS|RESULTS|The benefit of rituximab has not been conclusively ascertained yet.
26972210|ab|14|26972210||RESULTS|RESULTS|Acute therapeutic management is usually followed by low-dose maintenance therapy for one to three years.
26972210|ab|15|26972210||RESULTS|RESULTS|Skin lesions do not always respond sufficiently to myositis therapy.
26972210|ab|16|26972210||RESULTS|RESULTS|Effective treatment for such cases consists of topical corticosteroids and sometimes also calcineurin inhibitors.
26972210|ab|17|26972210||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Systemic therapies shown to be effective include antimalarial agents (also in combination), methotrexate, and corticosteroids.
26972210|ab|18|26972210||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Intravenous immunoglobulins or rituximab may also be helpful.
26972210|ab|19|26972210||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|UV protection is an important prophylactic measure.
29957670|ab|1|29957670|HYPOTHESIS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The retrofacial approach is a feasible approach to the round window niche and that the Round window-Sigmoid sinus line will help determine the feasibility of retrofacial approach for cochlear implantation unless there is a very high jugular bulb.
29957670|ab|2|29957670|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|When the round window cannot be visualized by facial recess approach during cochlear implantation, other conservative techniques can be used to improve visualization such as the retrofacial approach.
29957670|ab|3|29957670|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Thirteen adult dry cadaveric temporal bones were studied.
29957670|ab|4|29957670|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained on all temporal bones.
29957670|ab|5|29957670|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|An imaginary Round window-Sigmoid sinus line was drawn on the axial images.
29957670|ab|6|29957670|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We assessed whether this line is anterior (including intersection) or posterior to the facial nerve (FN).
29957670|ab|7|29957670|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The following closest distances were measured on CT scans: 1) posterior semicircular canal (PSC)-FN, 2) PSC-Stapedius muscle, 3) PSC-Jugular bulb, 4) lateral semicircular canal (LSC)-Jugular bulb, 5) sigmoid sinus-FN.
29957670|ab|8|29957670|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A canal wall-up mastoidectomy, facial recess, and retrofacial approach were performed in all specimens.
29957670|ab|9|29957670|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We have noted whether we need a standard or an extended mastoidectomy.
29957670|ab|10|29957670|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The Round window-Sigmoid sinus line was posterior to the FN in all specimens.
29957670|ab|11|29957670|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The retrofacial approach was feasible and the round window was visualized in all specimens.
29957670|ab|12|29957670|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Extended mastoidectomy was required in seven specimens and the PSC-FN was </= 3 mm in five of them.
29957670|ab|13|29957670|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Retrofacial approach is feasible in cochlear implantation when the Round window-Sigmoid sinus line is posterior to the FN and the jugular bulb is not obstructing the round window.
22436841|ab|1|22436841||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Health benefits of physical activity may depend on a concomitant weight loss.
22436841|ab|2|22436841||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In a randomized, controlled trial, we compared the effects of endurance training with or without weight loss to the effect of weight loss induced by an energy-reduced diet in 48 sedentary, moderately overweight men who completed a 12-week intervention program of training (T), energy-reduced diet (D), training and increased diet (T-iD), or control (C).
22436841|ab|3|22436841||METHODS|METHODS|An energy deficit of 600 kcal/day was induced by endurance training or diet in T and D and a similar training regimen plus an increased dietary intake of 600 kcal/day defined the T-iD group.
22436841|ab|4|22436841||METHODS|METHODS|Primary end point was insulin sensitivity as evaluated by HOMA-IR (mainly reflecting hepatic insulin sensitivity) and hyperinsulinemic, isoglycemic clamps (primarily reflecting peripheral insulin sensitivity).
22436841|ab|5|22436841||RESULTS|RESULTS|Body mass decreased in T and D by 5.9 +/- 0.7 and 5.3 +/- 0.7 kg, respectively, whereas T-iD and C remained weight stable.
22436841|ab|6|22436841||RESULTS|RESULTS|Total and abdominal fat mass were reduced in an additive manner in the T-iD, D, and T groups by 1.9 +/- 0.3/0.2 +/- 0.1, 4.4 +/- 0.7/0.5 +/- 0.1, and 7.7 +/- 0.8/0.9 +/- 0.1 kg, respectively.
22436841|ab|7|22436841||RESULTS|RESULTS|HOMA-IR was improved in T, D, and T-iD, whereas insulin-stimulated glucose clearance and suppression of plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) were increased only in the two training groups.
22436841|ab|8|22436841||RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|Thus, loss of fat mass (diet or training induced) improves hepatic insulin sensitivity, whereas peripheral insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue is increased by endurance training only.
22436841|ab|9|22436841||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This demonstrates that endurance training per se increases various metabolic health parameters and that endurance training should preferably always be included in any intervention regimen for improving metabolic health in moderately overweight men.

29865087|ab|2|29865087|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To characterize the lower limb weaknesses and physical limitations among the DM1 adult and late-onset phenotypes separately and to document the contribution of weaknesses on mobility to optimize the management of this population.
29865087|ab|3|29865087|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The strength of four muscle groups among 198 participants was quantified.
29865087|ab|4|29865087|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Participants were categorized according to the severity of their muscular involvement using the Muscular Impairment Rating Scale (MIRS).
29865087|ab|5|29865087|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Physical limitations were assessed using the Timed up-and-go (TUG), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and 10 meters comfortable walking speed (10MWT).
29865087|ab|6|29865087|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Multiple linear regressions were performed to identify the contribution of each muscle group to the mobility tests scores.
29865087|ab|7|29865087|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Late-onset demonstrated less weakness and physical limitations (p < 0.001 - 0.002) than the adult phenotype, but 21.9-47.5% of participants with this phenotype showed mobility scores below reference values.

29865087|ab|9|29865087|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Ankle dorsiflexors and knee extensors were the two muscle groups that showed the strongest relationships with mobility scores.
29865087|ab|10|29865087|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Although less impaired, the late-onset phenotype shows significant lower limb muscle weakness associated with physical limitations.
29865087|ab|11|29865087|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The surprising presence of quantitative lower limb muscle weakness in the first two MIRS grades needs to be considered when using this scale.

25229273|ab|1|25229273||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been associated with exposures in so-called 'electrical occupations'.
25229273|ab|2|25229273||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is unclear if this possible link may be explained by exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) or by electrical shocks.
25229273|ab|3|25229273||METHODS|METHODS|We evaluated ALS mortality in 2000-2008 and exposure to ELF-MF and electrical shocks in the Swiss National Cohort, using job exposure matrices for occupations at censuses 1990 and 2000.
25229273|ab|4|25229273||METHODS|METHODS|We compared 2.2 million workers with high or medium vs. low exposure to ELF-MF and electrical shocks using Cox proportional hazard models.
25229273|ab|5|25229273||RESULTS|RESULTS|Results showed that mortality from ALS was higher in people who had medium or high ELF-MF exposure in both censuses (HR 1.55 (95% CI 1.11-2.15)), but closer to unity for electrical shocks (HR 1.17 (95% CI 0.83-1.65)).
25229273|ab|6|25229273||RESULTS|RESULTS|When both exposures were included in the same model, the HR for ELF-MF changed little (HR 1.56), but the HR for electric shocks was attenuated to 0.97.
25229273|ab|7|25229273||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In conclusion, there was an association between exposure to ELF-MF and mortality from ALS among workers with a higher likelihood of long-term exposure.
19465701|ab|1|19465701||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is a multioscillator system that drives daily rhythms in mammalian behavior and physiology.
19465701|ab|2|19465701||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Based on recent data implicating vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) as the key intercellular synchronizing agent, we developed a multicellular SCN model to investigate the effects of cellular heterogeneity and intercellular connectivity on circadian behavior.
19465701|ab|3|19465701||METHODS|METHODS|A 2-dimensional grid was populated with 400 model cells that were heterogeneous with respect to their uncoupled rhythmic behavior (intrinsic and damped pacemakers with a range of oscillation periods) and VIP release characteristics (VIP producers and nonproducers).
19465701|ab|4|19465701||METHODS|METHODS|We constructed small-world network architectures in which local connections between VIP producing cells and their 4 nearest neighbors were augmented with random connections, resulting in long-range coupling across the grid.
19465701|ab|5|19465701||RESULTS|RESULTS|With only 10% of the total possible connections, the small-world network model was able to produce similar phase synchronization indices as a mean-field model with VIP producing cells connected to all other cells.
19465701|ab|6|19465701||RESULTS|RESULTS|Partial removal of random connections decreased the synchrony among neurons, the amplitude of VIP and cAMP response element binding protein oscillations, the mean period of intrinsic periods across the population, and the percentage of oscillating cells.
19465701|ab|7|19465701||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These results indicate that small-world connectivity provides the optimal compromise between the number of connections and control of circadian amplitude and synchrony.
19465701|ab|8|19465701||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This model predicts that small decreases in long-range VIP connections in the SCN could have dramatic effects on period and amplitude of daily rhythms, features commonly described with aging.

29877152|ab|2|29877152|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Maternal exposure to ZIKV through mosquitoes and sexual fluids creates a public health challenge for communities and policymakers, which is exacerbated by high levels of chronic non-communicable diseases in American Samoa.
29877152|ab|3|29877152|AIM|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study aimed to identify structural barriers to ZIKV prevention in American Samoa and situate them within locally relevant cultural and epidemiological contexts.
29877152|ab|4|29877152|SUBJECTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This study assessed knowledge, attitudes and access to ZIKV prevention among 180 adults in American Samoan public health clinics.
29877152|ab|5|29877152|SUBJECTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|It queried knowledge about pre-natal care, protection against mosquitoes and condom use.
29877152|ab|6|29877152|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Women were most likely to identify pre-natal care as important.
29877152|ab|7|29877152|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The majority of participants were able to identify how to prevent mosquito bites, but may have been unable to follow through due to socioeconomic and infrastructure limitations.

20507078|ab|1|20507078||BACKGROUND|METHODS|Uniform mesoporous TiO(2) nanospheres were successfully developed via an interfacial confined formation process for application in dye-sensitized solar cells.
20507078|ab|2|20507078||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The mesoporous spherical structures greatly promote the dye-loading capacity, electron transfer, and light scattering, resulting in remarkable enhancement of the cell performance.
20507078|ab|3|20507078||METHODS|RESULTS|The designed interfacial platform caused a reaction-limited aggregation of the TiO(2) nanocrystals, resulting in the formation of mesoporous spherical nanostructures with sphere diameter of 216 nm and pore size of 8 nm.

20507078|ab|6|20507078||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Owing to the enhanced light-harvesting efficiency, solar conversion efficiency was enhanced about 30% for the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) based on mesoporous spherical TiO(2) in comparison with that made by commercial TiO(2) nanoparticles.
27247945|ab|1|27247945||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a heterogeneous clinicopathological entity.
27247945|ab|2|27247945||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Two frameworks for the classification of FSGS have been described: etiologic and morphologic.
27247945|ab|3|27247945||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The etiologic classification is distinguished among genetic, adaptive, virus-associated, drug-induced, and idiopathic types.
27247945|ab|4|27247945||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Morphologic classification is commonly referred to as the Columbia classification published in 2004, which distinguishes five variants: collapsing, tip, cellular, perihilar, and not otherwise specified (NOS).
27247945|ab|5|27247945||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|This classification is based on light microscopic patterns with rigorously defined specific criteria, which can be applied to primary and secondary forms of FSGS, and has been widely used over the past 10 years both as a diagnostic and as a prognostic clinical tool.
27247945|ab|6|27247945||RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|This paper defines common histopathological features of FSGS, distinguished characters among five variants, and points out the confusion about terminology of variants, because most were proposed in the past with different definitions.
27247945|ab|7|27247945||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Despite good interobserver reproducibility of this classification system, difficulty in its application may arise in the interpretation of lesions with mixed features of more than one variant in the same tissue specimen and with late lesions, because other variants may evolve into the NOS variant over time.
29940576|ab|1|29940576|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Emphysematous destruction of lung parenchyma visible in computed tomography (CT) can be attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or to alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD).
29940576|ab|2|29940576|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We evaluated if visual semiquantitative phenotyping of CT data helps identifying individuals with AATD in a group of smokers with severe emphysema and airflow limitation.
29940576|ab|3|29940576|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|n = 14 patients with AATD and n = 15 with COPD and a minimum of 10 pack years underwent CT, clinical assessment, and full-body plethysmography.
29940576|ab|4|29940576|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|The extent and type of emphysema as well as large and small airway changes were rated semiquantitatively for each lobe using a standardized previously published scoring system.
29940576|ab|5|29940576|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|Lastly, a final diagnosis for each patient was proposed.
29940576|ab|6|29940576|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|AATD had a significantly lower mean emphysema score than COPD, with 8.9 +/- 3.4 versus 11.9 +/- 3.2 (p < 0.001), respectively.
29940576|ab|7|29940576|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Within both groups, there was significantly more emphysema in the lower lobes (p < 0.05-0.001).
29940576|ab|8|29940576|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The COPD group showed an upper- and middle-lobe predominance of emphysema distribution when compared to the AATD group (p < 0.001).
29940576|ab|9|29940576|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Centrilobular (CLE) and panlobular (PLE) emphysema patterns showed a uniform distribution within both groups, with a CLE predominance in the upper lung and a PLE predominance in the lower lung regions.
29940576|ab|10|29940576|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|AATD and COPD both showed significantly more airway changes in lower lobes compared to upper lobes (p = 0.05-0.001), without significant differences between both groups.
29940576|ab|11|29940576|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The typical emphysema distribution patterns seen on CT traditionally assigned to AATD and COPD were of little use in discriminating both entities.
29940576|ab|12|29940576|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Also, airway changes could not contribute to a more precise differentiation.
29940576|ab|13|29940576|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We conclude that a concise standardized phenotyping-driven approach to chest CT in emphysema is not sufficient to identify patients with AATD in a cohort of smokers with advanced emphysema.

29956107|ab|1|29956107|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Anastomotic leak is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in gastrointestinal surgery.
29956107|ab|2|29956107|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The serosal aspect of staple lines is commonly observed for integrity, but the mucosal surface and state of mucosa after firing is less often inspected.
29956107|ab|3|29956107|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We sought to assess the degree of mucosal capture when using stapling devices and determine whether incomplete capture influences staple line integrity.
29956107|ab|4|29956107|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Porcine ileum was transected in vivo and staple lines were collected and rated for degree of mucosal capture on a 5-point scale from 1 (mucosa mainly captured on both sides) to 5 (majority of mucosa not captured).
29956107|ab|5|29956107|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Mucosal capture was also assessed in ex vivo staple lines, and fluid leakage pressure and location of first leak was assessed.
29956107|ab|6|29956107|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Stapling devices studied were Echelon Flex GST with 60-mm blue (GST60B) and green (GST60G) cartridges, and Medtronic EndoGIA Universal with Tri-Staple Technology with 60 mm medium (EGIA60AMT) reloads (purple).
29956107|ab|7|29956107|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|GST60B and GST60G staple lines produced significantly better mucosal capture scores than the EGIA60AMT staple lines (p < 0.001, in all tests).

29948305|ab|1|29948305|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the effect of skeletal muscle and body fat on liver function in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosed by liver biopsy.
29948305|ab|2|29948305|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Among the 219 patients with NAFLD enrolled in this study was a cohort of 139 patients who had their body composition measured with Inbody720 at baseline and at >/= 1 year postbaseline, to elucidate the relationship between liver function and changes in skeletal muscle and body fat mass.
29948305|ab|3|29948305|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors influencing low skeletal muscle mass index (SMI, defined as 7 kg/m(2) in men, and 5.7 kg/m(2) in women) and the skeletal muscle mass to body fat mass ratio (SF ratio).
29948305|ab|4|29948305|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Of the 219 patients enrolled, 27 (12.3%) had a low SMI.
29948305|ab|5|29948305|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Patient age (> 70 years) and female gender were identified as risk factors for low SMI.
29948305|ab|6|29948305|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Hepatic fibrosis was not associated with SMI.
29948305|ab|7|29948305|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In the cohort followed up at baseline and 12 months later, transaminase activity, body fat mass, and SMI significantly decreased over time.
29948305|ab|8|29948305|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Changes in the SF ratio were significantly associated with changes in liver function.
29948305|ab|9|29948305|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|An increase in the SF ratio [hazard ratio (HR) 10.99 in men, 6.849 in women] was a predictor of reduced ALT, independent of age and other backgrounds.
29948305|ab|10|29948305|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In the patients with NAFLD, SMI was decreased, even in the early stages of NAFLD.

29876876|ab|1|29876876|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Caffeine is a widely used ergogenic aid with most research suggesting it confers the greatest effects during endurance activities.
29876876|ab|2|29876876|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Despite the growing body of literature around the use of caffeine as an ergogenic aid, there are few recent meta-analyses that quantitatively assess the effect of caffeine on endurance exercise.

29876876|ab|6|29876876|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Caffeine has a small but evident effect on endurance performance when taken in moderate doses (3-6 mg/kg) as well as an overall improvement following caffeine compared to placebo in mean power output (3.03 +/- 3.07%; effect size = 0.23 +/- 0.15) and time-trial completion time (2.22 +/- 2.59%; effect size = 0.41 +/- 0.2).
29876876|ab|7|29876876|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, differences in responses to caffeine ingestion have been shown, with two studies reporting slower time-trial performance, while five studies reported lower mean power output during the time-trial.
29876876|ab|8|29876876|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Caffeine can be used effectively as an ergogenic aid when taken in moderate doses, such as during sports when a small increase in endurance performance can lead to significant differences in placements as athletes are often separated by small margins.
29898793|ab|1|29898793|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Recent treatment studies with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) have demonstrated effects on both sleep problems and depression.
29898793|ab|2|29898793|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Two previous studies have indicated that the beneficial effect from CBT-I on depression may come through improved sleep, although insomnia severity during treatment had not previously been investigated as a mediator.
29898793|ab|3|29898793|AIMS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Our aim was to investigate if insomnia severity during treatment mediated between CBT-I and depression severity after treatment, in a sample with co-morbid insomnia and depressive symptomology.
29898793|ab|4|29898793|AIMS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We also examined whether depressive severity during treatment mediated between CBT-I and insomnia after treatment.
29898793|ab|5|29898793|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|The participants were recruited from advertisements and fulfilled criteria for insomnia diagnosis, and had depressive symptomatology (Beck Depression Inventory-second edition: BDI-II > 13).
29898793|ab|6|29898793|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|Two-thirds of the participants were diagnosed with major depressive disorder.
29898793|ab|7|29898793|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|The participants received four biweekly group sessions of CBT-I or relaxation training (active control).
29898793|ab|8|29898793|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|Insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index) and depressive severity (BDI-II) were measured at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up.
29898793|ab|9|29898793|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|The mid-treatment measures were used as mediators.
29898793|ab|10|29898793|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mediational analyses demonstrated a significant reciprocal relationship between insomnia severity and depressive severity throughout CBT-I, although mid-treatment insomnia had a stronger effect on depression than mid-treatment depression had on insomnia.
29898793|ab|11|29898793|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The results were similar for both post-treatment and follow-up.
29898793|ab|12|29898793|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Some improvement in depressive severity after CBT-I is explained by improved sleep.
29898793|ab|13|29898793|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The findings emphasize the importance of making comorbid insomnia a treatment focus in its own right.
24964716|ab|1|24964716||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Health activists often see the uptake of antiretroviral drugs and adherence to antiretroviral treatment as the outcome of 'treatment literacy.'
24964716|ab|2|24964716||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Organizations have invested considerable resources into educating the public in conventional scientific understandings of HIV and AIDS.
24964716|ab|3|24964716||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Drawing on the results of fieldwork in South Africa and the life history of a man living with AIDS, I highlight the complex and unstable relationship that exists between therapeutic literacy and treatment efficacy.
24964716|ab|4|24964716||RESULTS|RESULTS|Factors that have little to do with treatment literacy have impacted upon uptake and adherence.
24964716|ab|5|24964716||RESULTS|RESULTS|These include a lack of political support, stigma generated by labelling, access to social welfare, and gender constructs.
24964716|ab|6|24964716||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Moreover, in situations of medical pluralism, marked by multiple, constantly shifting understandings of sickness, it is very difficult to ascertain treatment literacy, and treatment literacy neither implies therapeutic efficacy, nor vice versa.

29947341|ab|1|29947341|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Hemin is an important sterile component that induces a neuroinflammatory response after intracerebral hemorrhage, in which NLRP3 inflammasome activation has also proved to be involved.
29947341|ab|2|29947341|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although microglial activation acts as a key contributor in the neuroinflammatory response, the relationship between hemin and NLRP3 in microglia remains poorly understood.
29947341|ab|3|29947341|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To investigate whether or not hemin regulates microglia-mediated secondary injury through activating the NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathway in microglia.
29947341|ab|4|29947341|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In this study, N9 microglial cells were treated with hemin, and subsequently used to detect the production of caspase-1 p10 and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly.
29947341|ab|5|29947341|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|An ELISA was subsequently performed to measure the secretion of IL-1beta.
29947341|ab|6|29947341|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|It was found that the production of activated caspase-1 was dose- and time-dependent with regards to hemin.
29947341|ab|7|29947341|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Moreover, hemin was observed to be capable of inducing the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome without any increase in IL-1beta.
29947341|ab|8|29947341|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Similarly, the supernatant of hemin-treated primary microglial cells did not increase in IL-1beta secretion.
29947341|ab|9|29947341|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, hemin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation did not significantly affect pyroptosis.
29947341|ab|10|29947341|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Hemin is a potential sterile danger signal molecule that can induce inflammasome activation without directly mediating inflammation damage on microglia.

29954662|ab|2|29954662|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, the sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.
29954662|ab|3|29954662|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|This article will focus on climate change and projected effects on venomous marine and amphibious creatures with the potential impact on human health.
29954662|ab|4|29954662|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Retrospective analysis of environmental, ecological, and medical literature with a focus on climate change, toxinology, and future modeling specific to venomous aquatic and amphibious creatures.
29954662|ab|5|29954662|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Species included venomous jellyfish, poisonous fish, crown-of-thorns starfish, sea snakes, and toxic frogs.
29954662|ab|6|29954662|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In several projected scenarios, rising temperatures, weather extremes, and shifts in seasons will increase poisonous population numbers, particularly with certain marine creatures like jellyfish and crown-of-thorns starfish.
29954662|ab|7|29954662|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Habitat expansions by lionfish and sea snakes are projected to occur.
29954662|ab|8|29954662|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|These phenomena, along with increases in human populations and coastal development will likely increase human-animal encounters.
29954662|ab|9|29954662|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Other species, particularly amphibious toxic frogs, are declining rapidly due to their sensitivity to any temperature change or subtle alterations in the stability of their environment.
29954662|ab|10|29954662|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|If temperatures continue to rise to record levels over the next decades, it is predicted that the populations of these once plentiful and critically important animals to the aquatic ecosystem will decline and their geographic distributions will shrink.
29954662|ab|11|29954662|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Review of the literature investigating the effect and forecasts of climate change on venomous marine and amphibious creatures has demonstrated that temperature extremes and changes to climatic norms will likely have a dramatic effect on these toxicological organisms.
29954662|ab|12|29954662|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The effects of climate change on these species through temperature alteration and rising coastal waters will influence each species differently and in turn potentially affect commercial industries, travel, tourism, and human health.

29954351|ab|2|29954351|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Recent qualitative evidence from Victorian Maternal and Child Health nurses indicate that infants of Chinese parents commonly have rapid growth trajectories and that high value is placed on rapid growth and having a fatter child; with low breastfeeding rates and overfeeding of infant formula.
29954351|ab|3|29954351|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to compare infant feeding practices (breastfeeding, infant formula, other liquids, solids) of Chinese-born and Australian-born mothers living in Australia.
29954351|ab|4|29954351|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Using the Australian National Infant Feeding Survey dataset (2010-2011), infant feeding data from Chinese-born mothers (n = 602) were compared with a random sub-sample of Australian-born mothers (n = 602).
29954351|ab|5|29954351|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Group differences on feeding practices were tested using Chi-square or t-tests and the effect of ethnicity on infant feeding behaviours assessed using regression.
29954351|ab|6|29954351|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared to infants of Australian-born mothers, infants of Chinese-born mothers were younger when they first consumed infant formula, water-based drinks and fruit juice and older when they first ate solid foods (p < 0.05).
29954351|ab|7|29954351|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, infants of Chinese-born mothers were less likely to have ever had cow's milk (OR: 0.37 95%CI:, 0.18-0.78) and solids (0.41, 0.25-0.68); but were more likely to have ever had infant formula (2.19, 1.32-3.62), water (2.45, 1.55-3.87), toddler milk (3.39, 1.60-7.18), water-based drinks (e.g. cordial, soft drink, tea; 2.48, 1.12-5.49), and fruit juice (4.03, 2.50-6.51).
29954351|ab|8|29954351|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Those </=4 months of age were more likely to have had water-based drinks (7.77, 1.96-30.77) and fruit juice (3.44, 1.14-10.38) (p < 0.05) compared to infants of Australian-born mothers.

29957267|ab|2|29957267|AIM|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim was to compare the emotional eating patterns of younger and older individuals and assess the role of expressive suppression in the association between affectivity and emotional eating in each of the age groups.
29957267|ab|3|29957267|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Participants were 210 individuals recruited by means of a convenience sampling, which intentionally included a wide age range, along with varied socio-economic and education levels.
29957267|ab|4|29957267|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Participants completed the short version of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, The Positive affect (PA) and Negative Affect (NA) Schedule and the Courtauld emotional control scale.
29957267|ab|5|29957267|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Data was analyzed for three age groups - young adults (aged 20-40), middle-aged adults (aged 41-60) and older adults (aged 61-87).
29957267|ab|6|29957267|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Emotional eating was present among all three age groups, but it gradually decreased with age.
29957267|ab|7|29957267|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The use of expressive suppression increased with age.
29957267|ab|8|29957267|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Levels of PA and NA did not differ across the age groups and were not associated with emotional eating, but expressive suppression predicted higher emotional eating.
29957267|ab|9|29957267|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The association between expressive suppression and emotional eating was moderated by age: with a stronger association for the younger group, a moderate association for the middle-aged group and no association for the older adults.
29957267|ab|10|29957267|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Emotional eating is present among older adults, although in lower intensity than younger individuals, and should be identified and treated by health and mental health practitioners.

29958187|ab|1|29958187|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Bone splitting and osteotome are common ridge expansion choices for patients with a narrow alveolar ridge requiring dental implant restoration.
29958187|ab|2|29958187|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Despite the effectiveness of the 2 techniques in horizontal ridge augmentation, they could also result in severe complications, which is thus considered a contraindication.
29958187|ab|3|29958187|MATERIALS AND METHODS|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|A modification of the bone splitting and the osteotome techniques is proposed hereby as an alternative.
29958187|ab|4|29958187|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The modified procedure reduces the tension of labial bone plate by creating a partial bone fracture at the most depressed area of labial defect where the thinner bone exists.
29958187|ab|5|29958187|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This technique is primarily useful for cases with a facial concavity.
29958187|ab|6|29958187|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The modification could prevent iatrogenic labial bone defect during the surgery, and compared with onlay bone grafting, it may shorten the overall treatment time and avoid traumatizing the bone donor site.

19723078|ab|1|19723078||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The essential trace element selenium and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been used for the prevention of cancer.
19723078|ab|2|19723078||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Both nutrients enhance the apoptosis of malignant cells and provide health benefits.
19723078|ab|3|19723078||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, an increased dietary intake of PUFA augments the susceptibility of lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage in many cells.
19723078|ab|4|19723078||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|So far, relatively few data are available about the interaction of selenium and PUFA in testis and thus a possible effect of both dietary components on the prevention of testicular cancer or on the apoptosis of testicular germ cells.
19723078|ab|5|19723078||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|Male germ cells in the rat contain most of the testicular phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), mainly as the mitochondrial isoform of this selenoprotein (m-PHGPx).
19723078|ab|6|19723078||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|An experiment was therefore carried out to determine the action of fish oil, a nutrient rich in PUFA, on the testicular expression of PHGPx.
19723078|ab|7|19723078||RESULTS|RESULTS|Because the PHGPx formation remains nearly unchanged in the animals fed the PUFA-enriched diet, we conclude that no apoptosis of testicular germ cells is induced by an increased intake of this nutrient.
19723078|ab|8|19723078||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The intake of fish oil in the selenium-deficient animal led to a markedly altered formation of several selenium-containing proteins, including sperm nuclei glutathione peroxidase (snGPx), also designated as the nuclear form of PHGPx (n-PHGPx), and a 10-kDa selenium-containing protein.

29954375|ab|1|29954375|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The prognostic value of preoperative controlling nutritional status (CONUT) has been reported in many malignancies.
29954375|ab|2|29954375|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|In present study, we aimed to clarify the prognostic impact of CONUT in gastric cancer (GC) receiving curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.
29954375|ab|3|29954375|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We retrospectively reviewed 697 consecutive patients undergoing curative surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage II-III GC between November 2000 and September 2012.
29954375|ab|4|29954375|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patients were classified into high (>/=3) and low (</=2) CONUT groups according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
29954375|ab|5|29954375|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Of the included patients, 217 (31.1%) belonged to the high CONUT group.
29954375|ab|6|29954375|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The high CONUT group had a significantly lower 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate than the low CONUT group (39.3 vs. 55.5%, P < 0.001).
29954375|ab|7|29954375|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|High CONUT score was significantly associated with larger tumor size, more lymph node metastasis, and poorer nutritional status, including lower body mass index (BMI), higher prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the presence of preoperative anemia (all P < 0.05).
29954375|ab|8|29954375|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Multivariate analysis revealed that CONUT score was an independent prognostic factor (HR: 1.553; 95% CI: 1.080-2.232; P = 0.017).
29954375|ab|9|29954375|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Of note, in the low PNI group, CONUT score still effectively stratified CSS (P = 0.016).

16999831|ab|1|16999831||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Adaptation of bacterial pathogens to an intracellular environment requires resetting of the expression levels of a wide range of both virulence and housekeeping genes.
16999831|ab|2|16999831||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We investigated the possibility that changes in DNA supercoiling could modulate the expression of genes known to be important in the intracellular growth of the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
16999831|ab|3|16999831||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|Our data show that DNA becomes relaxed when Salmonella grows in murine macrophage but not in epithelial cells, indicating that DNA supercoiling plays a role in discrimination between two types of intracellular environment.
16999831|ab|4|16999831||RESULTS|RESULTS|The ssrA regulatory gene within the SPI-2 pathogenicity island that is required for survival in macrophage was found to be upregulated by DNA relaxation.
16999831|ab|5|16999831||RESULTS|RESULTS|This enhancement of expression also required the Fis nucleoid-associated protein.
16999831|ab|6|16999831||RESULTS|RESULTS|Manipulating the level of the Fis protein modulated both the level of DNA supercoiling and ssrA transcription.
16999831|ab|7|16999831||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We discuss a model of bacterial intracellular adaptation in which Fis and DNA supercoiling collaborate to fine-tune virulence gene expression.
29957192|ab|1|29957192|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study sought to validate exercise capacity (EC) as a surrogate for mortality, hospitalization, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
29957192|ab|2|29957192|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|EC is often used as a primary outcome in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) trials of heart failure (HF) via direct cardiorespiratory assessment of maximum oxygen uptake (Vo2peak) or through submaximal tests, such as the 6-min walk test (6MWT).
29957192|ab|3|29957192|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|After a systematic review, 31 randomized trials of exercise-based CR compared with no exercise control (4,784 HF patients) were included.
29957192|ab|4|29957192|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Outcomes were pooled using random effects meta-analyses, and inverse variance weighted linear regression equations were fitted to estimate the relationship between the CR on EC and all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and HRQOL.
29957192|ab|5|29957192|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Spearman correlation coefficient (rho), R(2) at trial level, and surrogate threshold effect (STE) were calculated.
29957192|ab|6|29957192|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|STE represents the intercept of the prediction band of the regression line with null effect on the final outcome.
29957192|ab|7|29957192|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Exercise-based CR is associated with positive effects on EC measured through Vo2peak (+3.10 ml/kg/min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01 to 4.20) or 6MWT (+41.15 m; 95% CI: 16.68 to 65.63) compared to control.
29957192|ab|8|29957192|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The analyses showed a low level of association between improvements in EC (Vo2peak or 6MWT) and mortality and hospitalization.
29957192|ab|9|29957192|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Moderate levels of correlation between EC with HRQOL were seen (e.g., R(2) <52%;
29957192|ab|10|29957192|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Estimated STE was an increase of 5 ml/kg/min for Vo2peak and 80 m for 6MWT to predict a significant improvement in HRQOL.
29957192|ab|11|29957192|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The study results indicate that EC is a poor surrogate endpoint for mortality and hospitalization but has moderate validity as a surrogate for HRQOL.

29953484|ab|1|29953484|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Otitis media (OM) is a major reason for children's visits to physicians and a major cause of their being treated with antibiotics.
29953484|ab|2|29953484|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It not only causes economic burdens but also influences hearing, speech, and education.
29953484|ab|3|29953484|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|To our knowledge, no nationwide population-based study has assessed the association between air pollution and OM.
29953484|ab|4|29953484|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|Therefore, this study evaluated the association between air pollution levels and the incidence of OM.
29953484|ab|5|29953484|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We identified cases of OM that occurred in South Korea between January 2011 and December 2012 from the Korea National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database, and evaluated its relationship with five air pollutants: particulate matter (PM10, particulates </=10 mum in diameter), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide.
29953484|ab|6|29953484|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Associations between the weekly incidence of OM and the five air pollutants were analyzed using generalized estimating equations.
29953484|ab|7|29953484|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and their 99.9% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals after adjusting for gender, age, season, and region.
29953484|ab|8|29953484|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We based our analysis on 160,875 hospital visits for OM by children aged <15 years.
29953484|ab|9|29953484|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Correlations with higher concentrations of the five pollutants showed higher ORs than did the reference values at most time lags.
29953484|ab|10|29953484|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|PM10 had the largest influence on the OM incidence at a time lag of 0 weeks, whereas NO2 and O3 had the largest impacts on OM incidence at time lags of 1 and 4 weeks, respectively.
29953484|ab|11|29953484|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings support the notion that the incidence of OM is associated with ambient air pollution.

29895045|ab|2|29895045|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is fundamental to act as soon as possible, from very early childhood, to prevent harmful behaviors for health such as smoking and drinking alcohol.
29895045|ab|3|29895045|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Young people must be encouraged to adopt healthy lifestyles.
29895045|ab|4|29895045|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of the study is two-fold.
29895045|ab|5|29895045|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|First, increasing the knowledge about the negative health effects of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption among children aged 9-10 years; and second, to introduce and reinforce life skills in order to learn how to tackle social influences that encourage children to smoke and to drink alcohol.
29895045|ab|6|29895045|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A pilot randomized field trial was conducted in May-June 2017.
29895045|ab|7|29895045|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Four primary school classes in Rome were randomized to either the intervention or the control group.
29895045|ab|8|29895045|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Both groups participated in an oral presentation about the risks and consequences of smoking and alcohol consumption, and the concept of life skills.
29895045|ab|9|29895045|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The intervention group participated in two gaming sessions, each lasting 1.5 hours.
29895045|ab|10|29895045|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Children were involved in six games aiming to deliver and reinforce knowledge about the target themes of the study.
29895045|ab|11|29895045|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A 21 multi-response questions questionnaire was handed out to both groups at the beginning and at the end of the study.
29895045|ab|12|29895045|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Eleven questions were about smoking; five questions about alcohol; five questions about life skills.
29895045|ab|13|29895045|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Each question item included one correct answer.
29895045|ab|14|29895045|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|For each domain, a score was computed (total; smoking; alcohol; life skills).
29895045|ab|15|29895045|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|67 children participated in the study (34 in the intervention and 33 in the control group).
29895045|ab|16|29895045|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Univariate analyses showed significant differences among the intervention group before and after the intervention for total score (p<0.001), smoke score (p<0.001), and life skills score (p=0.003).
29895045|ab|17|29895045|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|No significant differences among the intervention group before and after the intervention were reported for alcohol score (p=0.076).
29895045|ab|18|29895045|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Regarding the control group univariate analysis showed significant differences in total score (p=0,001) and life skills score (p=0.005).

25090342|ab|2|25090342||OBJECTIVE|METHODS|The dome-shaped resonator was made of Norland blocking adhesive (NBA 107) doped with a solution of rhodamine 6G and ethanol.
25090342|ab|3|25090342||METHODS|METHODS|Two different configurations are considered: (i) resonator placed on top of a thin layer of 10:1 polydimethylsiloxane (10:1 PDMS), and (ii) resonator encapsulated in a thin layer of 10:1 PDMS.
25090342|ab|4|25090342||METHODS|METHODS|The microlaser was remotely pumped using a Q switch Nd:YAG laser with pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz, pulse linewidth of 10 ns, and pulse energy of 100 muJ/cm(2).
25090342|ab|5|25090342||RESULTS|RESULTS|The excited optical modes showed an average optical quality factor of 10(4) for both configurations.
25090342|ab|6|25090342||RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, the measurements showed sensitivity to temperature of ~0.06 nm/ degrees C and a resolution of 1 degrees C for both configurations.

29926483|ab|1|29926483|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Rate of progression of periodontitis has been used to inform the design of classifications of periodontal diseases.
29926483|ab|2|29926483|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, the evidence underpinning this topic is unclear and no systematic review has yet been conducted.
29926483|ab|3|29926483|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The focused question for this systematic review was: in adults, what is the progression of periodontitis in terms of clinical attachment loss, radiographic bone loss, and tooth loss?
29926483|ab|4|29926483|DATA SOURCES|METHODS|METHODS|Highly sensitive electronic search was conducted for published data in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and unpublished grey literature in OpenGrey up to February 2016.
29926483|ab|5|29926483|DATA SOURCES|METHODS|METHODS|Reference lists of retrieved studies for full-text screening and reviews were hand-searched for potentially eligible studies.
29926483|ab|6|29926483|DATA SOURCES|METHODS|METHODS|Prospective, longitudinal observational studies with follow-up of at least 12 months and presenting data on the primary outcome, change in clinical attachment level, in adults (age >/=18 years).
29926483|ab|7|29926483|DATA SOURCES|METHODS|METHODS|Secondary outcomes, tooth loss and bone level change, were only assessed in studies reporting the primary outcome.
29926483|ab|8|29926483|DATA SOURCES|METHODS|METHODS|Studies investigating specific disease populations or only on treated periodontitis patients were excluded.
29926483|ab|9|29926483|STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Risk of bias and methodology were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale with two additional questions on security of outcome assessment.
29926483|ab|10|29926483|STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Studies were pooled by abstracting or estimating mean annual attachment or bone level change and annual tooth loss.
29926483|ab|11|29926483|STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Random effects meta-analysis was conducted with investigation of effect of potential modifiers where possible.
29926483|ab|12|29926483|RESULTS|RESULTS|METHODS|A total 11,482 records were screened for eligibility; 33 publications of 16 original studies reporting on more than 8,600 participants were finally included as eligible for the review.
29926483|ab|13|29926483|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The studies represented populations from both developing and developed economies.
29926483|ab|14|29926483|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean annual attachment loss was 0.1 mm per year (95% CI 0.068, 0.132; I(2 ) = 99%) and mean annual tooth loss was 0.2 teeth per year (95% CI 0.10, 0.33; I(2 ) = 94%).
29926483|ab|15|29926483|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Observational analysis of highest and lowest mean attachment change quintiles suggested substantial differences between groups with minimal annual change in the lowest quintile and an average deterioration of 0.45 mm mean attachment loss per year in the highest group.
29926483|ab|16|29926483|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|This value increased to 0.6 mm per year with periodontitis alone.
29926483|ab|17|29926483|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was surprisingly little effect of age or gender on attachment level change.
29926483|ab|18|29926483|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Geographic location, however, was associated with more than three times higher mean annual attachment loss in Sri Lanka and China (0.20 mm, 95% CI 0.15, 0.27; I(2) = 83%) vs North America and Europe (0.056 mm, 95% CI 0.025, 0.087; I(2) = 99%) P < 0.001.
29926483|ab|19|29926483|LIMITATIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|There were a limited number of studies (N = 16), high variability of design in key study components (sampling frames, included ages, data analyses), and high statistical heterogeneity that could not be explained.
29926483|ab|20|29926483|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Within the limitations of the research, the data show that mean annual attachment level change varies considerably both within and between populations.

29948588|ab|1|29948588|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Despite recent advances in the treatment of eliminating accessory pathways (APs), catheter-induced mechanical block (bump) of APs has been reported to result in a less favorable outcome with high primary failure and recurrence rates.
29948588|ab|2|29948588|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|The real bump site cannot always be precisely reapproached under fluoroscopy so physicians can perform ablation to a location different from where the mechanical block was encountered.
29948588|ab|3|29948588|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In this paper, we describe this novel use of a 3-dimensional (3D) mapping system (playback ablation) with a case series.
29948588|ab|4|29948588|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The EnSite Velocity system (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA), a 3D mapping system, has a unique function that records the positional information of catheters in a 3D geometric map and the local potential of catheters continuously.
29948588|ab|5|29948588|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This function enables physicians to specify the bump site in a 3D geometric map and apply ablation to the bump site even if the catheter moves away from the bump site.
29948588|ab|6|29948588|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|This technique helped us eliminate APs in two patients with bump of APs, and they have been free of preexcitation and arrhythmias without the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs for more than 3 months.
29948588|ab|7|29948588|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This technique may contribute to improving long-term success in patients with mechanical block of APs.
27353184|ab|1|27353184||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has continued to cause sporadic outbreaks in Thailand since 2007 and a pandemic variant containing an insertion and deletion in the spike gene was responsible for outbreaks.
27353184|ab|2|27353184||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In 2014, there were further outbreaks of the disease occurring within four months of each other.
27353184|ab|3|27353184||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|In this study, the full-length genome sequences of two genetically distinct PEDV isolates from the outbreaks were characterized.
27353184|ab|4|27353184||RESULTS|RESULTS|The two PEDV isolates, CBR1/2014 and EAS1/2014, were 28,039 and 28,033 nucleotides in length and showed 96.2% and 93.6% similarities at nucleotide and amino acid levels respectively.
27353184|ab|5|27353184||RESULTS|RESULTS|In total, we have observed 1048 nucleotide substitutions throughout the genome.
27353184|ab|6|27353184||RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared to EAS1/2014, CBR1/2014 has 2 insertions of 4 ((56)GENQ(59)) and 1 ((140)N) amino acid positions 56-59 and 140, and 2 deletions of 2 ((160)DG(161)) and 1 ((1199)Y) amino acid positions 160-161 and 1199.
27353184|ab|7|27353184||RESULTS|RESULTS|The phylogenetic analysis based on full-length genome of CBR1/2014 isolate has grouped the virus with the pandemic variants.
27353184|ab|8|27353184||RESULTS|RESULTS|In contrast, EAS1/2014 isolate was grouped with CV777, LZC and SM98, a classical variant.
27353184|ab|9|27353184||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our findings demonstrated the emergence of EAS1/2014, a classical variant which is novel to Thailand and genetically distinct from the currently circulating endemic variants.
27353184|ab|10|27353184||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This study warrants further investigations into molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of the PEDV in Thailand.
21911402|ab|1|21911402||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We experimentally study the effects of a uniform electric field on the conformation of single DNA molecules.
21911402|ab|2|21911402||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|We demonstrate that a moderate electric field (~200 V/cm) strongly compresses isolated DNA polymer coils into isotropic globules.
21911402|ab|3|21911402||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|Insight into the nature of these compressed states is gained by following the expansion of the molecules back to equilibrium after halting the electric field.
21911402|ab|4|21911402||METHODS|RESULTS|We observe two distinct types of expansion modes: a continuous molecular expansion analogous to a compressed spring expanding, and a much slower expansion characterized by two long-lived metastable states.
21911402|ab|5|21911402||RESULTS|RESULTS|Fluorescence microscopy and stretching experiments reveal that the metastable states are the result of intramolecular self-entanglements induced by the electric field.
21911402|ab|6|21911402||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These results have broad importance in DNA separations and single molecule genomics, polymer rheology, and DNA-based nanofabrication.
29953087|ab|6|29953087|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To demonstrate the possibilities of differential diagnostics of DSM with HC using modern instrumental diagnostic methods.
29953087|ab|7|29953087|MATERIAL AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The study involved two clinical cases of patients with DSM and HC, who underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examination including EDI-OCT and OCT angiography, fluorescent angiography (FA), indocyanine-green angiography (ICG) and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits (MRI).
29953087|ab|8|29953087|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The most simple and highly informative method for differential diagnostic of DSM with HC is currently EDI-OCT.
29953087|ab|9|29953087|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In difficult differential diagnostic cases, it is recommended to use FA and MRI.
29953087|ab|10|29953087|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Additionally, for identification of the cause of SRD in DSM, OCT-angiography and ICG-angiography can be used.
29953087|ab|11|29953087|RESULTS|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|Thus, diagnostics of DSM is difficult today primarily because of the low awareness of ophthalmologists about the presence of such macula pathology.
29953087|ab|12|29953087|RESULTS|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|Detection of this anatomical feature by means of ophthalmoscopy alone can be difficult and requires special skills and experience.
29953087|ab|13|29953087|RESULTS|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|The use of EDI-OCT, as well as FA and MRI in difficult differential diagnostic cases, and correct interpretation of the obtained data can help avoid diagnostic errors.
29895247|ab|1|29895247|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Hippocampal mean diffusivity (MD) measured by diffusion-tensor imaging is a promising diagnostic marker for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia.
29895247|ab|2|29895247|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Its performance has yet to be evaluated in primary care patients, who vary systematically from patients visiting specialized care settings.
29895247|ab|3|29895247|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of hippocampus diffusivity for detecting MCI and dementia in a sample recruited from primary care, compared to a sample from specialized care.
29895247|ab|4|29895247|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|One sample was recruited from a primary care intervention trial (DelpHi-MV) (n=70), and the other sample was recruited from our memory clinic (n=70).
29895247|ab|5|29895247|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The samples were matched pairwise for diagnosis, MMSE, age, gender, and education.
29895247|ab|6|29895247|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|They included dementia patients, MCI patients and healthy subjects.
29895247|ab|7|29895247|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Mean MD was calculated for the left and right hippocampus, corrected for partial volume effects.
29895247|ab|8|29895247|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Within each sample, left or right hippocampal MD served as predictor for diagnostic group in logistic regressions, which were additionally controlled for white matter lesions.
29895247|ab|9|29895247|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In the primary care sample, hippocampal MD detected dementia with high cross-validated accuracy (left: AUC=.92; right: AUC=.85), but did not classify MCI with an accuracy above chance (left: AUC=.58; right: AUC=.44).
29895247|ab|10|29895247|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In the memory clinic sample, hippocampal MD classified both dementia (left: AUC=.91; right: AUC=.91) and MCI (left: AUC=.86; right: AUC=.83) with high cross-validated accuracy.
29895247|ab|11|29895247|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Hippocampal MD supported the identification of dementia but did not contribute to the detection of MCI in the primary care patient population.

29865035|ab|1|29865035|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Intensified treatment of head and neck cancers (HNC): by radiotherapy (RTH) commonly combined with cytotoxic drugs is associated with oral mucositis (OM).
29865035|ab|2|29865035|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Changes in the functioning of nucleotide synthesis pathway (RNR1, coded by RRM1 gene) can modulate the efficiency of cellular DNA repair mechanisms and influence the risk of occurrence and severity of OM in HNC patients after RTH.
29865035|ab|3|29865035|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between expression of RRM1 gene measured in free circulating RNA (cfRNA) and the risk of more severe OM and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing RTH for HNC.
29865035|ab|4|29865035|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The study included 60 patients treated with RTH for HNC.
29865035|ab|5|29865035|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|RRM1 gene expression was examined in circulating RNA isolated from peripheral blood plasma (before treatment).
29865035|ab|6|29865035|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|High RRM1 gene expression was significantly associated with higher risk of grade 3 OM after 5 (OR = 4.97), 6 (OR = 4.33) and 7 (OR = 3.50) weeks of RTH.
29865035|ab|7|29865035|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Expression of RRM1 gene was not significantly related with risk of DFS and OS shortening (however well separated Kaplan-Meier curves might suggest its potential prognostic impact).
29865035|ab|8|29865035|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The evaluation of RRM1 gene expression in cfRNA allows for estimation of the risk of severe OM in patients subjected to RTH.
27143622|ab|1|27143622||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Dendrite morphology is pivotal for neural circuitry functioning.
27143622|ab|2|27143622||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|While the causative relationship between small-scale dendrite morphological abnormalities (shape, density of dendritic spines) and neurodevelopmental disorders is well established, such relationship remains elusive for larger-scale dendrite morphological impairments (size, shape, branching pattern of dendritic trees).
27143622|ab|3|27143622||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Here, we summarize published data on dendrite morphological irregularities in human patients and animal models for neurodevelopmental disorders, with focus on autism and schizophrenia.
27143622|ab|4|27143622||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|We next discuss high-risk genes for these disorders and their role in dendrite morphogenesis.
27143622|ab|5|27143622||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|We finally overview recent developments in therapeutic attempts and we discuss how they relate to dendrite morphology.
27143622|ab|6|27143622||RESULTS|RESULTS|We find that both autism and schizophrenia are accompanied by dendritic arbor morphological irregularities, and that majority of their high-risk genes regulate dendrite morphogenesis.
27143622|ab|7|27143622||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Thus, we present a compelling argument that, along with smaller-scale morphological impairments in dendrites (spines and synapse), irregularities in larger-scale dendrite morphology (arbor shape, size) may be an important part of neurodevelopmental disorders' etiology.
27143622|ab|8|27143622||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We suggest that this should not be ignored when developing future therapeutic treatments.

29957265|ab|1|29957265|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The purpose of this study was to assess the role of remote magnetic navigation (RMN) in the ablation of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) arising from outflow tracts (OT) and valve annuli by comparing to manual control navigation (MCN).
29957265|ab|2|29957265|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 152 patients with frequent VPCs were prospectively enrolled.
29957265|ab|3|29957265|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|64 (42%) patients underwent ablation guided by RMN.
29957265|ab|4|29957265|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Acute success rate was defined as the complete elimination and non-inducibility of clinical VPCs during the procedure.
29957265|ab|5|29957265|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Overall, acute success rate of RMN group was not different from MCN group (87.5% vs 84.1%, p=0.56).
29957265|ab|6|29957265|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared to MCN group, the fluoroscopic time of OT-VPCs ablation in the RMN group was significantly reduced by 67% (2.9+/-2.3min vs 8.9+/-9.7min, p=0.006), and the ablation applications in successful cases were significantly reduced (11+/-7 vs 15+/-11, p=0.018).
29957265|ab|7|29957265|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared to MCN, RMN significantly decreased ablation applications (15+/-9 vs 23+/-9, p=0.013) in the acute success rates of ablating VPCs of valve annulus, and has a trend of a higher success rate for VPCs arising from tricuspid annulus (10/11 vs 7/12, p=0.193).
29957265|ab|8|29957265|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|No complications occurred in the RMN group.
29957265|ab|9|29957265|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Three cases of cardiac tamponade and one case of transient atrioventricular block occurred in the MCN group (p=0.22).
29957265|ab|10|29957265|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|After a mean follow up of 16.2months, 2/56 and 3/74 patients had a recurrence of VPCs in the RMN group and MCN group respectively (p=0.75).
29957265|ab|11|29957265|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|When compared to MCN, RMN-guided ablation for VPCs was just as effective and safe, with the added benefit of reduced fluoroscopic time and fewer ablation applications.
18615489|ab|1|18615489||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|The in vitro effects of polyalkyl-imide hydrogel (PAI) containing 96% pyrogen-free water on the viability, apoptosis, cell shape and metabolic activities of murine 3T3 and human Detroit 555 fibroblasts were investigated.
18615489|ab|2|18615489||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Analysis of the viscous-elastic properties and the ultrastructure of PAI, performed by rheometer and AFM respectively, showed that the material has the typical characteristics of hydrogel, including a three-dimensional configuration of molecules arranged in a regular network with many discrete caveolae where most of the water is captured.
18615489|ab|3|18615489||RESULTS|RESULTS|Hydrogel biocompatibility was found to be high for both cell lines, with some differences.
18615489|ab|4|18615489||RESULTS|RESULTS|Cell viability decreased more in 3T3 cells than Detroit 550 fibroblasts when cultured in the presence of 100 mg/ml hydrogel but not at concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/ml hydrogel.
18615489|ab|5|18615489||RESULTS|RESULTS|The period of incubation with PAI (24 and 48 h) only partially affected cell viability.
18615489|ab|6|18615489||RESULTS|RESULTS|Apoptosis, most likely due to cells' inability to adhere to the polymer, was the only type of cell death observed.
18615489|ab|7|18615489||RESULTS|RESULTS|Fibroblasts grown in the presence of polymer were always metabolically active since they continued to synthesize collagen.
18615489|ab|8|18615489||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In conclusion, PAI hydrogel, even at high concentrations, was biocompatible for both fibroblasts, but in particular for human cells, thus encouraging its use as a dermal filler.

22504317|ab|1|22504317||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Aging-associated cognitive impairment is an important health care issue since individuals with mild cognitive impairment are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.
22504317|ab|2|22504317||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In the present study, the protective effect of Gossypium herbaceam extracts (GHE) on learning and memory impairment associated with aging were examined in vivo using Morris water maze and step through task.
22504317|ab|3|22504317||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Furthermore, the antioxidant activity and neuroprotective effect of GHE was investigated with methods of histochemistry and biochemistry.
22504317|ab|4|22504317||RESULTS|RESULTS|These data showed that oral administration with GHE at the doses of 35, 70, and 140 mg/kg exerted an improved effect on the learning and memory impairment in aged rats.
22504317|ab|5|22504317||RESULTS|RESULTS|Subsequently, GHE afforded a beneficial action on eradication of free radicals without influence on the activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase.
22504317|ab|6|22504317||RESULTS|RESULTS|GHE treatment enhanced the expression levels of nerve growth factor.
22504317|ab|7|22504317||RESULTS|RESULTS|Meanwhile, proliferation of neural progenitor cells was elevated in hippocampus after treatment with GHE.
22504317|ab|8|22504317||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Taken together, neurogenic niche improvement could be involved in the mechanism underlying neuroprotection of GHE against aging-associated cognitive impairment.
22504317|ab|9|22504317||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings suggested that GHE might be a potential agent as cognitive-enhancing drugs that delay or halt mild cognitive impairment progression to Alzheimer's disease or treatment of aging-associated cognitive impairment.

29950208|ab|7|29950208|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Arsenic trioxide can inhibit the human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell proliferation, and its mechanism may be related with up-regulation of Mad2 expression and down-regulation of Cdc20 expression.
19220752|ab|1|19220752||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Escherichia coli survives pH 2 environments through an acid resistance (AR) system regulated by the transcriptional activator GadE.
19220752|ab|2|19220752||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Numerous proteins control gadE at an upstream, conserved, 798 bp intergenic region.
19220752|ab|3|19220752||METHODS|RESULTS|We show this region produces three transcripts starting at -124 (T1), -324/-317 (T2) and -566 (T3) bp from the gadE start codon.
19220752|ab|4|19220752||RESULTS|RESULTS|Transcriptional lacZ fusions to gadE promoter regions revealed P1 and P3 were active while P2 alone was not.
19220752|ab|5|19220752||RESULTS|RESULTS|However, pairing P3 with P2 activated P2 and increased expression 20-fold above P3 alone.
19220752|ab|6|19220752||RESULTS|RESULTS|The fusions were transferred to Salmonella, which lacks this AR system, and plasmid-borne E. coli-specific regulators EvgA, YdeO, GadE and GadX were introduced.
19220752|ab|7|19220752||RESULTS|RESULTS|Data revealed that YdeO and GadX activate P3, P2 and P3P2, while GadE autoactivates P1 and represses P3 and P3P2.
19220752|ab|8|19220752||RESULTS|RESULTS|The developing model indicates that different signals activate YdeO, GadX, or an MnmE-dependent regulator, which stimulate gadE transcription from the P3 and P2 promoters.
19220752|ab|9|19220752||RESULTS|RESULTS|Once made, GadE activates P1 and represses P3 and P2.
19220752|ab|10|19220752||RESULTS|RESULTS|The P1 region also enables efficient downstream transcription and translation of the P3 or P2 transcripts.
19220752|ab|11|19220752||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Evidence indicates the entire 750 bp sensory integration locus is necessary for a versatile response.

29940078|ab|1|29940078|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Corneal endothelial transplantation has become the gold standard for the treatment of corneal endothelial dysfunctions, replacing full thickness transplantation, known as penetrating keratoplasty.
29940078|ab|2|29940078|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Corneal endothelial transplantation has been described using two different techniques: Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) and Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK).
29940078|ab|3|29940078|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Both are still performed worldwide.
29940078|ab|4|29940078|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To compare the effectiveness and safety of Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) versus Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) for the treatment of corneal endothelial failure in people with Fuch's endothelial dystropy (FED) and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK).
29940078|ab|6|29940078|SEARCH METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The date of the search was 11 August 2017.
29940078|ab|7|29940078|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised paired, contralateral-eye studies in any setting where DMEK was compared with DSAEK to treat people with corneal endothelial failure.
29940078|ab|8|29940078|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial quality and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
29940078|ab|9|29940078|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|Our primary outcome was best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured in logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR).
29940078|ab|10|29940078|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|Secondary outcomes were endothelial cell count, graft rejection, primary graft failure and graft dislocation.
29940078|ab|11|29940078|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We graded the risk of bias of non-randomised studies (NRSs) using ROBINS-I.
29940078|ab|12|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We did not identify any RCTs but found four non-randomised studies (NRSs) including 72 participants (144 eyes), who had received DSAEK in the first eye followed by DMEK in the fellow eye.
29940078|ab|13|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|All the studies included adult participants where there was evidence of FED and endothelial failure requiring a corneal transplant for the treatment of visual impairment.
29940078|ab|14|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We did not find any studies that included PBK.
29940078|ab|15|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The trials were published between 2011 and 2015, and we assessed them as high risk of bias due to potential unknown confounding factors since DSAEK preceded DMEK in all participants.
29940078|ab|16|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Two studies reported results at 12 months, one at 6 months, and one between 6 and 24 months.
29940078|ab|17|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|At one year, using DMEK in cases of endothelial failure may result in better BCVA compared with DSAEK (mean difference (MD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to -0.10 logMAR, 4 studies, 140 eyes, low-certainty evidence).
29940078|ab|18|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|None of the participants had severe visual loss (BCVA of 1.0 logMAR or more; very low-certainty evidence).
29940078|ab|19|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Regarding endothelial cell count data (4 studies, 134 eyes) it is hard to draw any conclusions since two studies suggested no difference and the other two reported that DMEK provides a higher cell density at one year (very low-certainty evidence).
29940078|ab|20|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|No primary graft failure and only one graft rejection were recorded over four studies (144 eyes) (very low-certainty evidence).
29940078|ab|21|29940078|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The most common complications reported were graft dislocations, which were recorded in one or two out of 100 participants with DSAEK but were more common using DMEK, although this difference could not be precisely estimated (risk ratio (RR) 5.40, 95% CI 1.51 to 19.3; 4 studies, 144 eyes, very low-certainty evidence).
29940078|ab|22|29940078|AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This review included studies conducted on people with corneal endothelium failure due to FED for whom both DMEK and DSAEK can be considered, and found low-certainty evidence that DMEK provides some advantage in terms of final BCVA, at the cost of more graft dislocations needing 're-bubbling' (very low-certainty of evidence).

29877158|ab|2|29877158|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|This variant has also been reported to be associated with lower total cholesterol in Samoans.
29877158|ab|3|29877158|AIM|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study is to examine the association of rs373863828:G > A with levels of serum lipids in four Pacific populations.
29877158|ab|4|29877158|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 613 adult subjects were recruited from Tonga (Polynesians) and the Solomon Islands (Melanesians and Micronesians).
29877158|ab|5|29877158|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age and sex were performed to examine the association of rs373863828 with levels of serum lipids in each population.
29877158|ab|6|29877158|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A significant association of rs373863828:G > A with lower level of HDL-cholesterol was detected in the Tonga population (beta = -3.32 and p-value = 0.030).
29877158|ab|7|29877158|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The expected change in HDL-cholesterol with respect to a single copy of the rs373863828-A allele was 3.32 mg/dL.
29877158|ab|8|29877158|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, the association between rs373863828-A and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol was not significant after further adjustment for BMI in the Tonga population (beta = -2.32 and p-value = 0.13).
29877158|ab|9|29877158|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The rs373863828-A allele may not directly affect the level of serum HDL-cholesterol independent of BMI.
29877158|ab|10|29877158|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|To confirm the present findings, association studies with large sample sizes and functional analyses are required.

29952013|ab|3|29952013|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In a controlled study, interferon-based therapy was associated with a lower virological response in vasculitic patients than in patients without vasculitis.
29952013|ab|4|29952013|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Limited, uncontrolled data on direct-acting anti-virals are available.
29952013|ab|5|29952013|AIM|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To evaluate safety, clinical efficacy, virological response and the impact of interferon-free treatment on QoL in HCV patients with and without mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC).
29952013|ab|6|29952013|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We prospectively studied HCV patients with cryoglobulinaemia (with vasculitis-CV- and without vasculitis-MC-) and without cryoglobulinaemia (controls), treated with direct-acting anti-virals.
29952013|ab|7|29952013|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Hepato-virological parameters, CV clinical response and impact on QoL were assessed.
29952013|ab|8|29952013|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|One hundred and eighty-two HCV patients were recruited (85 with CV, 54 with MC and 43 controls).
29952013|ab|9|29952013|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR12) was achieved in 166 (91.2%) patients (77/85 CV, 48/54 MC, 41/43 controls).
29952013|ab|10|29952013|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In CV SVR patients, cryocrit levels progressively decreased and clinical response progressively improved, reaching 96.7%, 24 weeks after treatment.
29952013|ab|11|29952013|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|QoL, baseline physical and mental component summaries were lower in the CV group compared to the other groups (P < 0.05).
29952013|ab|12|29952013|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Scores improved in all groups, and significantly in CV patients after SVR.
29952013|ab|13|29952013|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|No significant differences in SVR rates were recorded between cryoglobulinaemic patients and controls and a high clinical and immunological efficacy was confirmed in CV, supporting the role of interferon-free therapy as the first therapeutic option.

29885568|ab|1|29885568|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Acting with integrity is a central part of nursing practice.
29885568|ab|2|29885568|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, literature shows that professional integrity can be absent and where this is present it can face challenges.
29885568|ab|3|29885568|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Governmental Inquiries have revealed deficits in the expression of nursing values which underpin professional integrity, in particular caring, compassionate and competent practice that maintains the dignity of patients.
29885568|ab|4|29885568|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Evidence also suggests that it cannot be taken for granted that pre-registration education will have a positive impact on student nurses' ability to practice with integrity.
29885568|ab|5|29885568|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This research explored students', mentors' and lecturers' experiences of professional integrity in pre-registration nurse education.
29885568|ab|6|29885568|METHODOLOGY|METHODS|METHODS|A grounded theory approach was informed by the work of Charmaz (2004, 2006).
29885568|ab|7|29885568|CONTEXT|BACKGROUND|METHODS|The study, which took place in a UK university, involved four fields of nursing practice: Adult, Children, Mental Health and Learning Disabilities.
29885568|ab|8|29885568|PARTICIPANTS|METHODS|METHODS|12 student nurses, 5 practice-based mentors and 6 lecturers participated.
29885568|ab|9|29885568|FINDINGS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Semi-structured interviews and focus groups revealed three main themes: meanings, enactment and growth of professional integrity.
29885568|ab|10|29885568|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Pre-registration education can influence the growth of professional integrity by improving students' understanding of the boundaries of nursing practice and potential threats to these, skills to speak up on behalf of patients, and knowledge of the processes involved in raising concerns about practice and potential barriers to this.
29885568|ab|11|29885568|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The proactive development of student nurses' strategies to cope, alongside increasing their understanding of the importance of this is also likely to be beneficial.
29953478|ab|1|29953478|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|Aim was to develop a full automatic clustering approach of the time-activity curves (TAC) from dynamic 18F-FET PET and evaluate its association with IDH1 mutation status and survival in patients with gliomas.
29953478|ab|2|29953478|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Thirty-seven patients (mean age: 45+/-13 y) with newly diagnosed gliomas and dynamic 18F-FET PET before any histopathologic investigation or treatment were retrospectively included.
29953478|ab|3|29953478|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Each dynamic 18F-FET PET was realigned to the first image and spatially normalized in the Montreal Neurological Institute template.
29953478|ab|4|29953478|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A tumor mask was semi-automatically generated from Z-score maps.
29953478|ab|5|29953478|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Each brain tumor voxel was clustered in one of the 3 following centroids using dynamic time warping and k-means clustering (centroid #1: slowly increasing slope; centroid #2: rapidly increasing followed by slowly decreasing slope; and centroid #3: rapidly increasing followed by rapidly decreasing slope).
29953478|ab|6|29953478|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The percentage of each dynamic 18F-FET TAC within tumors and other conventional 18F-FET PET parameters (maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios [TBRmax and TBRmean], time-to-peak [TTP] and slope) was compared between wild-type and IDH1 mutant tumors.
29953478|ab|7|29953478|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Their prognostic value was assessed in terms of progression free-survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier estimates.
29953478|ab|8|29953478|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Twenty patients were IDH1 wild-type and 17 IDH1 mutant.
29953478|ab|9|29953478|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Higher percentage of centroid #1 and centroid #3 within tumors were positively (P = 0.016) and negatively (P = 0.01) correlated with IDH1 mutated status.
29953478|ab|10|29953478|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Also, TBRmax, TBRmean, TTP, and slope discriminated significantly between tumors with and without IDH1 mutation (P range 0.01 to 0.04).
29953478|ab|11|29953478|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Progression occurred in 22 patients (59%) at a median of 13.1 months (7.6-37.6 months) and 13 patients (35%) died from tumor progression.
29953478|ab|12|29953478|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Patients with a percentage of centroid #1 > 90% had a longer survival compared with those with a percentage of centroid #1 < 90% (P = 0.003 for PFS and P = 0.028 for OS).
29953478|ab|13|29953478|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|This remained significant after stratification on IDH1 mutation status (P = 0.029 for PFS and P = 0.034 for OS).
29953478|ab|14|29953478|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared to other conventional 18F-FET PET parameters, TTP and slope were associated with PFS and OS (P range 0.009 to 0.04).
29953478|ab|15|29953478|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Based on dynamic 18F-FET PET acquisition, we developed a full automatic clustering approach of TAC which appears to be a valuable noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with gliomas.
29878344|ab|1|29878344|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In this pilot study, the purpose is to investigate if a series of sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) blockade treatments modulate the functional connectivity within the salience and central executive network (CEN) in chronic migraine with medication overuse headaches (CM(w/MOH) ).
29878344|ab|2|29878344|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Using intranasal local anesthesia to block the SPG for the treatment of various headache disorders has been employed in clinical practice since the early 1900s.
29878344|ab|3|29878344|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, the exact mechanism of how SPG modulate resting state intrinsic functional brain networks connectivity remains to be elucidated.
29878344|ab|4|29878344|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|This pilot study seeks to understand the resting state connectivity changes in salience and CENs, with emphasis on the mesocorticolimbic systems, before and after a series of SPG block treatments.
29878344|ab|5|29878344|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Using fMRI, resting state connectivity was derived from predefined networks of nodes (regions of interests) for the salience (27 nodes, 351 connections) and CENs (17 nodes, 136 connections).
29878344|ab|6|29878344|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|After treatments, a paired samples t-test (with 10,000 permutations to correct for multiple comparison) was used to evaluate changes in the intranetwork resting state functional connectivity within the salience and executive networks, as well as the overall network connectivity strength.
29878344|ab|7|29878344|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|When comparing connectivity strength at baseline to that at the end of treatment in our cohort of 10 CM(w/MOH) participants, there were several connections within the salience (n = 9) and executive (n = 8) networks that were significantly improved.
29878344|ab|8|29878344|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Within the salience network, improved connectivity was observed between the prefrontal cortex and various regions of the insula, basal ganglia, motor, and frontal cortex.
29878344|ab|9|29878344|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Additionally, changes in connectivity were observed between regions of the temporal cortex with the basal ganglia and supramarginal gyrus.
29878344|ab|10|29878344|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Within the CEN, improved connectivity was observed between the prefrontal cortex and regions of the anterior thalamus, caudate, and frontal cortex.
29878344|ab|11|29878344|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|After treatment, the overall CEN connectivity was significantly improved (Baseline 0.00 +/- 0.08; 6 weeks 0.03 +/- 0.09, P = .01); however, the overall salience network connectivity was not significantly improved (Baseline -0.01 +/- 0.10; 6 weeks 0.01 +/- 0.12, P = .26).
29878344|ab|12|29878344|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Additionally, after treatment, there was a significant reduction in the number of moderate/severe headache days per month (Baseline 21.1 +/- 6.6; 6 weeks 11.2 +/- 6.5, P < .001), HIT-6 (Baseline 66.1 +/- 2.6; 6 weeks 60.2 +/- 3.6, P < .001), and PHQ-9 (Baseline 12.4 +/- 5.7; 6 weeks 6.1 +/- 3.6, P = .008) scores.
29878344|ab|13|29878344|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In this longitudinal fMRI study, we observed improved functional connectivity within both networks, primarily involving connectivity between regions of the prefrontal cortex and limbic (cortical-limbic) structures, and between different cortical (cortical-cortical) regions after a series of repetitive SPG blockades.
29878344|ab|14|29878344|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The overall CEN strength was also improved.
29878344|ab|15|29878344|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our results suggest that recurrent parasympathetic inhibition via SPG is associated with improved functional connectivity in brain regions critical to pain processing in CM(w/MOH) .
29954360|ab|1|29954360|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|There is a need for valid approaches to measure sexual interactions to assess the impact of behavioural interventions and to predict the impact of behaviour changes.
29954360|ab|2|29954360|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Different methods of asking about sexual behaviour often yield conflicting answers and men often report higher levels of heterosexual activity than women.
29954360|ab|3|29954360|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|To better understand self-reported sexual behaviour data and how best to collect it, we analyzed data collected as part of a larger project (ST IMPACTS) on the social and behavioural impact of introducing community-level HIV self-testing (HIVST) with counseling (semi-supervised with pre- and generic post-test counseling provided on delivery or collection of test kits) in an urban Malawian setting.
29954360|ab|4|29954360|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Information on sexual behaviour was collected from HIV self-testers over a three-month period.
29954360|ab|5|29954360|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Three different methods were used: retrospective face-to-face interviews (FTFI); audio computer assisted self-interviews (ACASI) and a prospective coital diary.
29954360|ab|6|29954360|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Both retrospective instruments were used before and after the three-month study period.
29954360|ab|7|29954360|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Frequency and cross-tabulation, as well as scatterplots, were used for exploratory analyses.
29954360|ab|8|29954360|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Chi-square tests were used to test for differences in proportions.
29954360|ab|9|29954360|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to explore associations between both continuous and ordinal variables and Wilcoxon's paired sample and Mann-Whitney test was used to test for differences in such variables or between variables.
29954360|ab|10|29954360|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was reasonable agreement between the two retrospective methods although both yielded inconsistent answers e.g. with lower reported numbers of life-time sexual partners at the end than at the beginning of the study period.
29954360|ab|11|29954360|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The diary method elicited higher reported levels of sex with multiple partners than both retrospective instruments which may be due to inadequate recall.
29954360|ab|12|29954360|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Over the study period 37.4% of men and 19.7% of women reported multiple sexual partners using the diary.
29954360|ab|13|29954360|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was no clear relationship between reported sexual behaviour and HIV status (prevalence 9.6%).
29954360|ab|14|29954360|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Diaries may therefore have higher validity for sensitive behaviour reporting and thus be the preferred method in similar African contexts in measuring sexual behaviours.

25250672|ab|3|25250672||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Typically, the dependency between focal species and other species is characterised using other species' point occurrences as spatial covariates to constrain the focal species' predicted range.
25250672|ab|4|25250672||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|This implicitly assumes that the strength of interdependency is homogeneous across space, which is not generally supported by analyses of species interactions.
25250672|ab|5|25250672||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|This discrepancy has an important bearing on the accuracy of inferences about habitat suitability for species.
25250672|ab|6|25250672||METHODS|METHODS|We introduce a framework that integrates principles from consumer-resource analyses, resource selection theory and species distribution modelling to enhance quantitative prediction of species geographical distributions.
25250672|ab|7|25250672||RESULTS|METHODS|We show how to apply the framework using a case study of lynx and snowshoe hare interactions with each other and their environment.
25250672|ab|8|25250672||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The analysis shows how the framework offers a spatially refined understanding of species distribution that is sensitive to nuances in biophysical attributes of the environment that determine the location and strength of species interactions.

25060584|ab|2|25060584||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Flavor, aroma, and texture, among other attributes, are significantly affected during such processes.
25060584|ab|3|25060584||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|To improve those quality attributes, alternative approaches to sterilizing meat and meat products have been explored in the last few years.
25060584|ab|4|25060584||RESULTS|RESULTS|Most of the new strategies for sterilizing meat products rely on using thermal approaches, but in a more efficient way than in conventional methods.
25060584|ab|5|25060584||RESULTS|RESULTS|Some of these emerging technologies have proven to be reliable and have been formally approved by regulatory agencies such as the FDA.
25060584|ab|6|25060584||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Additional work needs to be done in order for these technologies to be fully adopted by the food industry and to optimize their use.
25060584|ab|7|25060584||RESULTS|RESULTS|Some of these emerging technologies for sterilizing meat include pressure assisted thermal sterilization (PATS), microwaves, and advanced retorting.

29948973|ab|2|29948973|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We prospectively analysed the epidemiology, microbiology and outcomes of 51 BSI episodes occurring in 48 patients with HNC (2006-2017).
29948973|ab|3|29948973|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We performed a retrospective matched-cohort study (1:2) to determine the risk factors for BSI.
29948973|ab|4|29948973|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Finally, we compared patients who died with those who survived to identify risk factors for mortality.
29948973|ab|5|29948973|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The most frequent HNC localization was the oropharynx (43%), and pneumonia was the most frequent source (25%).
29948973|ab|6|29948973|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Gram-positive BSI occurred in 55% cases, mainly due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (21%), and among Gram-negatives, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequent.
29948973|ab|7|29948973|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Hypoalbuminemia (OR 8.4; 95% CI, 3.5-19.9), previous chemotherapy (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.4) and cetuximab therapy (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6-6.7) were significant risk factors for BSI.
29948973|ab|8|29948973|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Patients with BSI had a higher overall case-fatality rate than patients without BSI (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.7-11.8).
29948973|ab|9|29948973|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Hypoalbuminemia was an independent risk factor for the early (7 day) and overall (30 day) case-fatalities, with ORs of 0.8 (95% CI, 0.6-0.9) and 0.8 (95% CI, 0.7-0.97), respectively.
29948973|ab|10|29948973|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The presence of comorbidities (OR, 7; 95% CI, 1.4-34) was also an independent risk factor for overall case-fatality.
29948973|ab|11|29948973|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|BSI causes high mortality in patients with HNC and is most often secondary to pneumonia.

29954018|ab|2|29954018|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Mechanism for reacting to, and coping with, stress in persons with alcohol addiction are an important factor enabling them to maintain abstinence in everyday life.
29954018|ab|3|29954018|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Also of Relevance for abstinence, and in particular craving for alcohol, is the severity of the dependence.
29954018|ab|4|29954018|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Numerous studies have focused on the duration of abstinence, but not on the severity of the disease.
29954018|ab|5|29954018|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study investigates if, in addition to abstinence duration, also the severity of the alcohol addiction influences stress responsiveness and ability to cope with stress.
29954018|ab|6|29954018|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Another objective is to ascertain in which patients such an influence can be found.
29954018|ab|7|29954018|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The results can shed light on the complex bidirectional relationship between alcoholism and stress, but are also potentially useful in treating patients with this disease.
29954018|ab|8|29954018|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In a cross-sectional design, 64 alcohol-dependent patients and 30 healthy controls were examined.
29954018|ab|9|29954018|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The alcoholics sample was divided in two groups according to a duration of abstinence of seven days and, 70 days.
29954018|ab|10|29954018|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Each group was further divided in a subgroup of individuals with mild to moderate alcohol addiction and in a subgroup of patients with severe alcohol addiction (A7-severe and A70-severe).
29954018|ab|11|29954018|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Using the Trierer Social Stress Test (TSST), all participants were subjected to acute stress.
29954018|ab|12|29954018|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Parameters measured were salivary cortisol, skin conductance -response, heart rate, addiction-related variables (addiction severity, duration of alcohol abuse, drinking quantity, craving, liver enzymes, family history of alcoholism, number of therapies, smoking), psychopathological variables (anxiety, depression, live events, personality disorders), acute and long-term stress coping, and level of strain on everyday life.
29954018|ab|13|29954018|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In patients with severe addiction, the reaction to stress is weaker and slightly retarded, but also of a longer duration than that patients with mild and moderate addiction and of healthy controls.
29954018|ab|14|29954018|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|This is independent of the length of abstinence (7 days and 70 days).
29954018|ab|15|29954018|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In severely ill patients, strategies for coping with acute stress differed from those of the other groups in that they consisted in stronger flight and avoidance responses, a stronger need for social support, and a more intense mental preoccupation.
29954018|ab|16|29954018|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Increased levels of social tension, lack of social recognition, and isolation indicated chronic stress.
29954018|ab|17|29954018|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Patients with severe alcohol addiction also showed a more pronounced familial predisposition, stronger craving, increased anxiety, a longer history of alcohol abuse, and a higher frequency of incisive life events than patients with mild to moderate alcohol addiction.
29954018|ab|18|29954018|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The results indicate that a more differentiated evaluation of stress responsiveness and stress coping in persons with an alcohol addiction not only length of abstinence, but also severity of disease have to be taken into account.

20007704|ab|1|20007704||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors, the structural elements that couple ligand binding to channel opening remain poorly defined.
20007704|ab|2|20007704||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine if Loop 9 on the non-GABA binding site interface of the beta2-subunit may be involved in GABA(A) receptor activation.
20007704|ab|3|20007704||METHODS|METHODS|Specifically, residues Gly(170)-Gln(185) of the beta2-subunit were mutated to alanine, co-expressed with wild-type alpha1- and gamma2S-subunits in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and assayed for their activation by GABA, the intravenous anesthetic propofol and the endogenous neurosteroid pregnanolone using whole cell macroscopic recordings.
20007704|ab|4|20007704||RESULTS|RESULTS|Three mutants, G170A, V175A, and G177A, produced 2.5-, 6.7-, and 5.6-fold increases in GABA EC(50) whereas one mutant, Q185A, produced a 5.2-fold decrease in GABA EC(50).
20007704|ab|5|20007704||RESULTS|RESULTS|None of the mutations affected the ability of propofol or pregnanolone to potentiate a submaximal GABA response, but the Q185A mutant exhibited 8.3- and 3.5-fold increases in the percent direct activation by propofol and pregnanolone, respectively.
20007704|ab|6|20007704||RESULTS|RESULTS|Mutant Q185A receptors also had an increased leak current that was sensitive to picrotoxin, indicating an increased gating efficiency.
20007704|ab|7|20007704||RESULTS|RESULTS|Further Q185E, Q185L, and Q185W substitutions revealed a strong correlation between the hydropathy of the amino acid at this position and the GABA EC(50).
20007704|ab|8|20007704||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Taken together, these results indicate that beta2 Loop 9 is involved in receptor activation by GABA, propofol, and pregnanolone and that beta2(Q185) participates in hydrophilic interactions that are important for stabilizing the closed state of the GABA(A) receptor.

19587052|ab|1|19587052||METHODS|METHODS|We report on a proteomic analysis of ex vivo human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection in human primary CD4 cells by shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, revealing two distinct proteomic profiles at two phases of virus replication.
19587052|ab|2|19587052||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Relative to mock-infected cells, 168 signature proteins exhibited abundance changes at the first sign of Gag p24 production (8 h postinfection [p.i.]) or the peak of virus replication (24 h p.i.); interestingly, most of the changes were exclusive to only one phase of virus replication.
19587052|ab|3|19587052||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Based on characterization by functional ontology and known human-HIV protein interactions, we observed the enrichment for protein abundance increases pertaining to protein synthesis and nucleasomal reorganization amid an otherwise placid cellular proteome at the first sign of HIV replication.
19587052|ab|4|19587052||RESULTS|RESULTS|In contrast, we observed indications of decreased protein turnover, concomitant with heightened DNA repair activities and preludes to apoptosis, in the presence of robust virus replication.
19587052|ab|5|19587052||RESULTS|RESULTS|We also observed hints of disruptions in protein and small molecule trafficking.
19587052|ab|6|19587052||RESULTS|RESULTS|Our label-free proteomic strategy allowed us to perform multiplexed comparisons-we buttressed our detection specificity with the use of a reverse transcriptase inhibitor as a counterscreen, enabling highlighting of cellular protein abundance changes unique to robust virus replication as opposed to viral entry.
19587052|ab|7|19587052||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In conjunction with complementary high-throughput screens for cellular partners of HIV, we put forth a model pinpointing specific rerouting of cellular biosynthetic, energetic, and trafficking pathways as HIV replication accelerates in human primary CD4 cells.
16844342|ab|1|16844342||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Serine/threonine phosphatase regulation of phosphorylation-mediated intracellular signaling controls a number of important processes in mammalian cells.
16844342|ab|2|16844342||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|In this study, we show that constitutively active protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a serine/threonine phosphatase, is essential for T leukemia cell survival.
16844342|ab|3|16844342||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Jurkat and CCRF-CEM T leukemia cells treated with the PP2A-selective inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) showed a dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis, as indicated by loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi(m)), cleavage-induced activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and DNA fragmentation.
16844342|ab|4|16844342||RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, caspase-8 or caspase-9 inhibition with z-IETD-fmk or z-LEHD-fmk, respectively, largely prevented OA-induced apoptosis.
16844342|ab|5|16844342||RESULTS|RESULTS|Although OA treatment did not affect constitutive Bcl-2 expression, overexpression of Bcl-2 prevented both OA-induced DNA fragmentation and dissipation of delta psi(m).
16844342|ab|6|16844342||RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-3, -8, or -9 partially protected against OA-induced loss of delta psi(m).
16844342|ab|7|16844342||RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, caspase-9 and caspase-3 inhibition largely prevented procaspase-3 and procaspase-8 cleavage, respectively, while caspase-8 inhibition partially interfered with procaspase-9 cleavage in OA-treated T leukemia cells.
16844342|ab|8|16844342||RESULTS|RESULTS|Thus, PP2A inhibition triggered the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which was enhanced by a mitochondrial feedback amplification loop.
16844342|ab|9|16844342||RESULTS|RESULTS|PP2A has also been implicated in the regulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
16844342|ab|10|16844342||RESULTS|RESULTS|Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a physical association between the catalytic subunit of PP2A and p38 MAPK in T leukemia cells.
16844342|ab|11|16844342||RESULTS|RESULTS|Moreover, OA treatment caused p38 MAPK to be phosphorylated in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, indicating that PP2A prevented p38 MAPK activation.
16844342|ab|12|16844342||RESULTS|RESULTS|Although p38 MAPK activation usually promotes apoptosis, pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK exacerbated OA-induced DNA fragmentation and loss of delta psi(m) in T leukemia cells, suggesting that, in this instance, the p38 MAPK signaling pathway promoted cell survival.
16844342|ab|13|16844342||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Collectively, these findings indicate that PP2A and p38 MAPK have coordinate effects on signaling pathways that regulate the survival of T leukemia cells.

26237111|ab|6|26237111||RESULTS|RESULTS|We identify four technology categories that support self-management: computer-based educational technologies demonstrated improved short-term gains in knowledge (2 studies), interface pressure mapping technologies demonstrated improved adherence to pressure-relief schedules up to 3 mo (5 studies), electrical stimulation confirmed improvements in tissue tolerance after 8 wk of training (3 studies), and telemedicine programs demonstrated improvements in independence and reduced hospital visits over 6 mo (2 studies).
26237111|ab|7|26237111||RESULTS|RESULTS|Overall, self-management technologies demonstrated low-to-moderate effectiveness in addressing a subset of risk factors.
26237111|ab|8|26237111||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|However, the effectiveness of technologies in preventing PUs is limited due to a lack of incidence reporting.
26237111|ab|9|26237111||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In light of the key findings, we recommend developing integrated technologies that address multiple risk factors.
29923841|ab|1|29923841|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Cyanoacrylates, also known as tissue adhesives or skin glues, are commonly used as sealants for lacerations and incisions and have found utility in excisional and cosmetic surgeries in both outpatient and operating room settings.
29923841|ab|2|29923841|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To review the surgical literature on the utilities, advantages, disadvantages, and special uses of cyanoacrylates applicable to dermatology.
29923841|ab|3|29923841|MATERIALS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|PubMed was reviewed for relevant articles related to cyanoacrylates and their use in skin closures.
29923841|ab|4|29923841|MATERIALS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Articles unrelated to cutaneous closures were excluded.
29923841|ab|5|29923841|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Tissue adhesives polymerize to a water resistant, pliable film after application to approximated wound edges and have antibacterial properties.
29923841|ab|6|29923841|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Adhesives slowly slough off as the wound heals, typically after 5 days.
29923841|ab|7|29923841|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared with 5-0 nonabsorbable suture, adhesives provide similar tensile strength and similar patient and surgeon satisfaction.
29923841|ab|8|29923841|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Although slightly more expensive than sutures, tissue adhesives obviate the need for wound dressings and suture removal.
29923841|ab|9|29923841|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|They do not perform as well as sutures for wounds under higher tension or in the setting of moisture and inadequate hemostasis.
29923841|ab|10|29923841|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Cyanoacrylates serve as a safe and effective suture alternative in appropriate dermatologic surgeries and procedures.
22664638|ab|1|22664638||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Polycomb complexes function as enforcers of epigenetically repressed state, balanced by an antagonist state mediated by Trithorax.
22664638|ab|2|22664638||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|Using sensitive methods of sequence analysis, we show here that Polycomb-like proteins (PCLs) contain a tandem of intimately associated domains, which we named PWAPA and which is also present in ASH2L, a member of the Trithorax group.
22664638|ab|3|22664638||METHODS|RESULTS|Polycomb-like proteins and ASH2L belong to the PCR2 and MLL histone methyltransferase complexes, respectively.
22664638|ab|4|22664638||RESULTS|RESULTS|A PWAPA cassette is also present in ATAC2, a component of the ATAC histone acetyltransferase complex.
22664638|ab|5|22664638||RESULTS|RESULTS|The recently solved structure of the PWAPA tandem of ASH2L has revealed that it consist in a PHD-like finger followed by a helix-winged-helix (WH) domain, able to bind DNA.
22664638|ab|6|22664638||RESULTS|RESULTS|The modeling of the 3D structure of the different members of the PWAPA family suggests that the PHD-like finger might be able, at least for some proteins of the family, to bind methylated marks on histones.
22664638|ab|7|22664638||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The PWAPA PHD/WH cassette might thus be involved in the combined recognition of DNA and specific (perhaps methylation) mark(s) on histones, thereby allowing the recruitment of specific chromatin-modifying activities at these sites.
22664638|ab|8|22664638||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The observations reported here should help to unravel the exact role played by the PWAPA cassette in the different proteins of the PWAPA family, and especially in the antagonistic activities of PcG and TrxG proteins.

20518031|ab|1|20518031||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Organization of the stromal compartments in secondary lymphoid tissue is a prerequisite for an efficient immune reaction.
20518031|ab|2|20518031||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In particular, follicular dendritic cells (FDC) are pivotal for the activation and differentiation of B cells.
20518031|ab|3|20518031||METHODS|METHODS|To investigate the development of FDC, FDC together with tightly associated B cells (FDC networks) were micro-dissected from frozen tissue sections and follicular B cells were sorted by FACS.
20518031|ab|4|20518031||METHODS|METHODS|Using an in silico subtraction approach, gene expression of FDC was determined and compared with that of follicular stromal cells micro-dissected from the spleen of SCID mice.
20518031|ab|5|20518031||RESULTS|RESULTS|Nearly 90% of the FDC genes were expressed in follicular stromal cells of the SCID mouse, providing further evidence that FDC develop from the residual network of reticular cells.
20518031|ab|6|20518031||RESULTS|RESULTS|Thus, it suggests that rather minor modifications in the gene expression profile are sufficient for differentiation into mature FDC.
20518031|ab|7|20518031||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The analysis of different immune-deficient mouse strains shows that a complex pattern of gene regulation controls the development of residual stromal cells into mature FDC.
20518031|ab|8|20518031||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The in silico subtraction approach provides a molecular framework within which to determine the diverse roles of FDC in support of B cells and to investigate the differentiation of FDC from their mesenchymal precursor cells.
18555972|ab|1|18555972||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Clonorchis sinensis causes the important food-borne zoonosis, clonorchiasis, which is endemic in East Asia, especially in China mainly in Guangdong, Guangxi and Heilongjiang provinces and Korea.
18555972|ab|2|18555972||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although comparisons on isoenzymes and some molecular profiles of C. sinensis collected from different parts of China and Korea have been studied, few works on the genetic variation among the individuals from different regions of China has been reported.
18555972|ab|3|18555972||METHODS|METHODS|In the present study, individual adults of C. sinensis were collected from cats in two geographic locations (Guangdong province in the South and Heilongjiang province in the North) of China and 44 of them were examined by using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR and mobile genetic elements (MGEs)-PCR techniques to assess the individual genetic variability within and between the two groups of this parasite.
18555972|ab|4|18555972||METHODS|METHODS|Six arbitrary primers and two pairs of MGE primers were employed in the genomic DNA amplification.
18555972|ab|5|18555972||RESULTS|RESULTS|The molecular patterns showed significant polymorphism among the individuals.
18555972|ab|6|18555972||RESULTS|RESULTS|The RAPD data displayed that the similarity coefficient (SC) of the individuals within Heilongjiang group was much higher than that of the Guangdong group, which was further confirmed by MGE-PCR results.
18555972|ab|7|18555972||RESULTS|RESULTS|Individuals from Heilongjiang were found genetically closer with lesser polymorphisms than those collected from Guangdong province.
18555972|ab|8|18555972||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These results demonstrated that RAPD and MGE-PCR techniques, particularly RAPD method, could be useful for investigating genetic variations among C. sinensis individuals.
18555972|ab|9|18555972||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|They may also indicate that the genetic variation of C. sinensis occurs in the subtropical region--Guangdong--faster than that in the cold-region--Heilongjiang province--due to more generations (life cycle) occurred.

23688315|ab|2|23688315||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study was designed to explore the applicability of a moderation model and a mediation model in explaining the relations between sense of belonging to the gay community, body image dissatisfaction and self-esteem among 90 self-identified Australian gay men.
23688315|ab|3|23688315||METHODS|METHODS|Participants completed the psychological subscale of the Sense of Belonging Instrument, the Body Satisfaction Scale, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.
23688315|ab|4|23688315||RESULTS|RESULTS|Results supported the moderation model; the relation between body image dissatisfaction and self-esteem was found to be statistically significant only at average and high levels of belonging to the gay community.
23688315|ab|5|23688315||RESULTS|RESULTS|The mediation model was also supported; body image dissatisfaction partially mediated the sense of belonging-self-esteem relation.

29863903|ab|1|29863903|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Research suggests that reduced retail alcohol outlet density may be associated with lower prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
29863903|ab|2|29863903|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|On-premise sale of alcohol for immediate consumption is theorized as increasing social interactions that can lead to sexual encounters.
29863903|ab|3|29863903|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We examined associations between on- and off-premise retail alcohol sales licenses and number of newly diagnosed HIV and STI cases in Texas counties.
29863903|ab|4|29863903|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Retail alcohol sales license data were obtained from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.

29869723|ab|2|29869723|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and a greater long-term risk of chronic kidney disease.
29869723|ab|3|29869723|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To study the incidence and outcome of neonatal AKI in a single Saudi Arabian center, level 2\3 NICU.
29869723|ab|4|29869723|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This single-center prospective cohort study included all infants who received level II or III NICU care during 2015 (January to December).
29869723|ab|5|29869723|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We excluded infants who survived less than 48 h after admission, had evidence of congenital renal anomalies, or had insufficient data.
29869723|ab|6|29869723|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria.
29869723|ab|7|29869723|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Both AKI and non-AKI neonates were prospectively followed up until NICU discharge.
29869723|ab|8|29869723|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Outcomes studied included mortality and length of NICU stay.
29869723|ab|9|29869723|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The results of adjusted risk analyses were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
29869723|ab|10|29869723|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The incidence of AKI (modified neonatal KDIGO stages) was 56% (120/214 patients).
29869723|ab|11|29869723|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared with neonates without AKI, those with AKI had a lower birth weight (2202 +/- 816 vs. 1570 +/- 776 g; p < 0.001) and a lower gestational age (35 +/- 3 vs. 32 +/- 4 weeks; p < 0.001).
29869723|ab|12|29869723|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|After adjustment for potential confounders, only gestational age (RR, 4.8; 95% CI, 3-9) and perinatal depression (RR, 10; 95% CI, 2-46) were significantly associated with an increased risk of AKI.

29869723|ab|14|29869723|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|After adjustment for gestational age, AKI was significantly associated with mortality (RR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2-14), but not with the length of hospital stay (LOS) (p = 0.133).
29869723|ab|15|29869723|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, the AKI group had a significantly longer LOS (mean difference: 14 days; 95% CI, 5.5-23 days), and 33 patients (27.5%) with AKI were discharged with abnormally high serum creatinine levels (> 65 mumol/L).
29869723|ab|16|29869723|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|AKI occurred in more than half of all NICU admissions, was associated with an increased risk of mortality, and had a higher incidence among smaller and sicker infants.
29869723|ab|17|29869723|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Therefore, close monitoring of renal function during hospitalization and after discharge is warranted in such infants.
21700308|ab|1|21700308||METHODS|METHODS|A 2000 mm long saturated laboratory soil column was used to simulate soil aquifer treatment under saturated conditions to assess the removal of chemical and biochemical oxygen demand (COD and BOD), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen and phosphate, using high strength artificial wastewater.
21700308|ab|2|21700308||METHODS|METHODS|The removal rates were determined under a combination of constant hydraulic loading rates (HLR) and variable COD concentrations as well as variable HLR under a constant COD.
21700308|ab|3|21700308||METHODS|RESULTS|Within the range of COD concentrations considered (42 mg L-1-135 mg L-1) it was found that at fixed hydraulic loading rate, a decrease in the influent concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen and phosphate improved their removal efficiencies.
21700308|ab|4|21700308||RESULTS|RESULTS|At the high COD concentrations applied residence times influenced the redox conditions in the soil column.
21700308|ab|5|21700308||RESULTS|RESULTS|Long residence times were detrimental to the removal process for COD, BOD and DOC as anoxic processes and sulphate reduction played an important role as electron acceptors.
21700308|ab|6|21700308||RESULTS|RESULTS|It was found that total COD mass loading within the range of 911 mg d-1-1780 mg d-1 applied as low COD wastewater infiltrated coupled with short residence times would provide better effluent quality than the same mass applied as a COD with higher concentration at long residence times.
21700308|ab|7|21700308||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The opposite was true for organic nitrogen where relatively high concentrations coupled with long residence time gave better removal efficiency.

29938789|ab|3|29938789|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Symptoms typically are intermittent and may worsen over a short time, leading to an exacerbation.
29938789|ab|4|29938789|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Asthma exacerbations can be serious, leading to hospitalisation or even death in rare cases.
29938789|ab|5|29938789|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Exacerbations may be treated by increasing an individual's usual medication and providing additional medication, such as oral steroids.
29938789|ab|6|29938789|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although antibiotics are sometimes included in the treatment regimen, bacterial infections are thought to be responsible for only a minority of exacerbations, and current guidance states that antibiotics should be reserved for cases in which clear signs, symptoms, or laboratory test results are suggestive of bacterial infection.
29938789|ab|7|29938789|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To determine the efficacy and safety of antibiotics in the treatment of asthma exacerbations.
29938789|ab|8|29938789|SEARCH METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains records compiled from multiple electronic and handsearched resources.
29938789|ab|9|29938789|SEARCH METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies.
29938789|ab|10|29938789|SEARCH METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We conducted the most recent search in October 2017.
29938789|ab|11|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We included studies comparing antibiotic therapy for asthma exacerbations in adults or children versus placebo or usual care not involving an antibiotic.
29938789|ab|12|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We allowed studies including any type of antibiotic, any dose, and any duration, providing the aim was to treat the exacerbation.
29938789|ab|13|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We included parallel studies of any duration conducted in any setting and planned to include cluster trials.
29938789|ab|14|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We excluded cross-over trials.
29938789|ab|15|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We included studies reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only, and unpublished data.
29938789|ab|16|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|At least two review authors screened the search results for eligible studies.
29938789|ab|17|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We extracted outcome data, assessed risk of bias in duplicate, and resolved discrepancies by involving another review author.
29938789|ab|18|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs), and continuous data as mean differences (MDs), all with a fixed-effect model.
29938789|ab|19|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We described skewed data narratively.
29938789|ab|20|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|We graded the results and presented evidence in 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison.
29938789|ab|21|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|Primary outcomes were intensive care unit/high dependence unit (ICU/HDU) admission, duration of symptoms/exacerbations, and all adverse events.
29938789|ab|22|29938789|SELECTION CRITERIA|METHODS|METHODS|Seconday outcomes were mortality, length of hospital admission, relapse after index presentation, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).
29938789|ab|23|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Six studies met our inclusion criteria and included a total of 681 adults and children with exacerbations of asthma.
29938789|ab|24|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean age in the three studies in adults ranged from 36.2 to 41.2 years.
29938789|ab|25|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The three studies in children applied varied inclusion criteria, ranging from one to 18 years of age.
29938789|ab|26|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Five studies explicitly excluded participants with obvious signs and symptoms of bacterial infection (i.e. those clearly meeting current guidance to receive antibiotics).
29938789|ab|27|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Four studies investigated macrolide antibiotics, and two studies investigated penicillin (amoxicillin and ampicillin) antibiotics; both studies using penicillin were conducted over 35 years ago.
29938789|ab|28|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Five studies compared antibiotics versus placebo, and one was open-label.
29938789|ab|29|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Study follow-up ranged from one to twelve weeks.
29938789|ab|30|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Trials were of varied methodological quality, and we were able to perform only limited meta-analysis.
29938789|ab|31|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|None of the included trials reported ICU/HDU admission, although one participant in the placebo group of a study including children with status asthmaticus experienced a respiratory arrest and was ventilated.
29938789|ab|32|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Four studies reported asthma symptoms, but we were able to combine results for only two macrolide studies of 416 participants; the MD in diary card symptom score was -0.34 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.60 to -0.08), with lower scores (on a 7 point scale) denoting improved symptoms.
29938789|ab|33|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Two macrolide studies reported symptom-free days.
29938789|ab|34|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|One study of 255 adults authors reported the percentage of symptom-free days at 10 days as 16% in the antibiotic group and 8% in the placebo group.
29938789|ab|35|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In a further study of 40 children study authors reported significantly more symptom-free days at all time points in the antibiotic group compared with the usual care group.
29938789|ab|36|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The same study reported the duration in days of the index asthma exacerbation, again favouring the antibiotic group.
29938789|ab|37|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|One study of a penicillin including 69 participants reported asthma symptoms at hospital discharge; the between-group difference for both studies was reported as non-significant.We combined data for serious adverse events from three studies involving 502 participants, but events were rare; the three trials reported only 10 events: five in the antibiotic group and five in the placebo group.
29938789|ab|38|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We combined data for all adverse events (AEs) from three studies, but the effect estimate is imprecise (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.43).
29938789|ab|39|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|No deaths were reported in any of the included studies.Two studies investigating penicillins reported admission duration; neither study reported a between-group difference.
29938789|ab|40|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In one study (263 participants) of macrolides, two participants in each arm were reported as experiencing a relapse, defined as a further exacerbation, by the six-week time points.
29938789|ab|41|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We combined PEFR endpoint results at 10 days for two macrolide studies; the result favoured antibiotics over placebo (MD 23.42 L/min, 95% CI 5.23 to 41.60).
29938789|ab|42|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|One study in children reported the maximum peak flow recorded during the follow-up period, favouring the clarithromycin group, but the confidence interval includes no difference (MD 38.80, 95% CI -11.19 to 88.79).
29938789|ab|43|29938789|MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Grading of outcomes ranged from moderate to very low quality, with quality of outcomes downgraded for suspicion of publication bias, indirectness, imprecision, and poor methodological quality of studies.
29938789|ab|44|29938789|AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We found limited evidence that antibiotics given at the time of an asthma exacerbation may improve symptoms and PEFR at follow-up compared with standard care or placebo.
29938789|ab|45|29938789|AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|However, findings were inconsistent across the six heterogeneous studies included, two of the studies were conducted over 30 years ago and most of the participants included in this review were recruited from emergency departments, limiting the applicability of findings to this population.
29938789|ab|46|29938789|AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Therefore we have limited confidence in the results.
29938789|ab|47|29938789|AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We found insufficient evidence about several patient-important outcomes (e.g. hospital admission) to form conclusions.
29938789|ab|48|29938789|AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We were unable to rule out a difference between groups in terms of all adverse events, but serious adverse events were rare.

23317364|ab|2|23317364||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) is important hydrolytic enzyme involved in the regulation of specific types of messengers, with significant roles in the innate immune response.
23317364|ab|3|23317364||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|A number of agents that exert effects on cellular receptors emit a series of signals leading to the increased activity of PLA(2).
23317364|ab|4|23317364||RESULTS|RESULTS|Phospholipase A(2) has been identified and characterized in temperature, plasma concentration, and kinetic dependence in two species of caiman.
23317364|ab|5|23317364||RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|The results of these studies suggest that the high PLA(2) activities observed in caiman plasma may be an important component of a well-developed innate immunity.
23317364|ab|6|23317364||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Based on the knowledge of their properties, this powerful immunologic component should be evaluated as a possible application in the veterinary or even human therapeutic industry.

29936188|ab|1|29936188|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Current level of asthma control can be easily assessed by validated instruments, but it is currently difficult to assess individuals' level of future risk.
29936188|ab|2|29936188|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Develop, and validate, a risk prediction score for level of future risk, including patient characteristics and information on early treatment response.
29936188|ab|3|29936188|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We used data of 304 adult patients with asthma from a 12-month primary care randomized controlled trial with 3-monthly assessments.
29936188|ab|4|29936188|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|With logistic regression we modeled the association between the level of future risk and patient characteristics including early treatment response.
29936188|ab|5|29936188|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Future risk was defined as Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score of 1.5 or more at 12 months or the experience of at least 1 exacerbation during the final 6 months.
29936188|ab|6|29936188|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We developed a risk prediction score on the basis of regression coefficients.
29936188|ab|7|29936188|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Performance of the risk prediction score improved, taking into account data on early treatment response (area under receiver-operating curve [AUROC] = 0.84) compared with a model containing only baseline characteristics (AUROC = 0.78).
29936188|ab|8|29936188|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The score includes 6 easy-to-obtain predictors: sex, ACQ score and exacerbations in the previous year at baseline and at first follow-up, and smoking status and exacerbations in the previous 3 months (indicating early treatment response).
29936188|ab|9|29936188|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|External validation yielded an AUROC of 0.77.
29936188|ab|10|29936188|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The risk prediction score classified patients into 3 risk groups: low (absolute risk, 11.7%), intermediate (47.0%), and high (72.7%).
29936188|ab|11|29936188|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We developed and externally validated a risk prediction score, quantifying both level of current asthma control and the guideline-defined future risk.
29936188|ab|12|29936188|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Patients' individual risk can now be estimated in an easy way, as proposed but not specified, by asthma management guidelines.
29940563|ab|1|29940563|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The aetiology of infantile colic remains unknown.
29940563|ab|2|29940563|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, altered gut microbiota composition has been reported in children with the disorder.
29940563|ab|3|29940563|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The objective of this study was to determine the associations between perinatal factors potentially affecting gut colonization and infantile colic.
29940563|ab|4|29940563|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Altogether 48 infants with colic and 29 controls were selected from 2 ongoing clinical studies.
29940563|ab|5|29940563|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Infants with and without colic were comparable with regard to their background characteristics.
29940563|ab|6|29940563|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A significant difference was detected in intrapartum antibiotic use and breastfeeding rates between infants with and without colic.
29940563|ab|7|29940563|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The association between exposure to intrapartum antibiotics and infantile colic remained statistically significant after adjusting for potential confounding factors.
29940563|ab|8|29940563|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Since intrapartum antibiotic exposure may have an effect on early gut colonization, our finding is consistent with the association between aberrant early gut microbiota composition and development of colic.

28708430|ab|1|28708430||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Photodynamic molecules represent an alternative approach for cancer therapy for their property (i) to be photo-reactive; (ii) to be not-toxic for target cells in absence of light; (iii) to accumulate specifically into tumour tissues; (iv) to be activable by a light beam only at the tumour site and (v) to exert cytotoxic activity against tumour cells.
28708430|ab|2|28708430||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, to date their clinical use is limited by the side effects elicited by systemic administration.

29897822|ab|1|29897822|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Weight loss from exercise is often less than expected.
29897822|ab|2|29897822|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Putative compensatory mechanisms may limit exercise-induced reductions in body fat and might be proportional to exercise energy expenditure.
29897822|ab|3|29897822|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To determine compensation (difference between accumulated exercise energy expenditure and changes in body tissue energy stores) and compensatory responses to 1500 or 3000 kcal/week of exercise energy expenditure.
29897822|ab|4|29897822|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Overweight to obese (n=36) sedentary men and women were randomized to groups expending 300 or 600 kcal/exercise session, 5 days/week, for 12 weeks.
29897822|ab|5|29897822|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|14 participants in the 300 kcal group and 15 in the 600 kcal group completed the study.
29897822|ab|6|29897822|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The primary outcome was energy compensation assessed through changes in body tissue energy stores.
29897822|ab|7|29897822|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Secondary outcomes were putative compensatory responses of resting metabolic rate (RMR), food reinforcement, dietary intake, and serum acylated ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).
29897822|ab|8|29897822|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|All measures were determined pre- and post-training.
29897822|ab|9|29897822|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The 3000 kcal/week group decreased (<0.01) percentage and kg body fat while the 1500 kcal/week group did not.
29897822|ab|10|29897822|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The 1500 and 3000 kcal/week groups compensated 943 (-164 to 2050) and 1007 (32 to 1982) kcal/week (mean, 95% CI, P>0.93), or 62.9% and 33.6% of exercise energy expenditure, respectively.
29897822|ab|11|29897822|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|RMR and energy intake did not change.
29897822|ab|12|29897822|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Food reinforcement and GLP-1 decreased (P<0.02), while acylated ghrelin increased (P<0.02).
29897822|ab|13|29897822|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Compensation is not proportional to exercise energy expenditure.
29897822|ab|14|29897822|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Similar energy compensation occurred in response to1500 kcal/week and 3000 kcal/week of exercise energy expenditure.
29897822|ab|15|29897822|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Exercise energy expenditure of 3000 kcal/week is great enough to exceed compensatory responses and reduce fat mass.

16947119|ab|1|16947119||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To search out novel biomarkers for monitoring diabetes prognosis, we examined the effect of hypoglycemic fungal exopolysaccharides (EPS) on the differential levels of plasma proteins in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
16947119|ab|2|16947119||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|The orally administrated EPS exhibited an excellent hypoglycemic effect, lowering the average plasma glucose level, and increasing insulin secretion in diabetic rats.
16947119|ab|3|16947119||METHODS|RESULTS|The 2-DE analysis of rat plasma demonstrated that about 500 visualized spots were differentially regulated, of which 20 spots were identified as principal diabetes-associated proteins.
16947119|ab|4|16947119||RESULTS|RESULTS|The distinct effect of diabetes induction on the pattern of rat plasma proteins includes the down-regulation of albumin, apolipoprotein E (Apo E), alpha1-inhibitor-3, fetuin beta, Gc-globulin, hemopexin, vitronectin, and transthyretin (TTR) monomer, and the up-regulation of Apo A-I, Apo A-IV, ceruloplasmin, alpha1-antitrypsin, serine protease inhibitor III, and transferrin.
16947119|ab|5|16947119||RESULTS|RESULTS|Those protein levels were interestingly restored to those of healthy rats by EPS treatment, although the order of magnitude of the changes differed widely.
16947119|ab|6|16947119||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Two proteins of interest showed distinct differential expression with opposite trends: TTR tetramer was significantly down-regulated and immunoglobulin (Ig) kappa light chain was significantly up-regulated upon diabetes induction, both of which were also normalized to those of healthy groups after EPS treatment.
26283574|ab|1|26283574||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a small organic compound whose concentration in blood increases after ingesting dietary l-carnitine and phosphatidylcholine.
26283574|ab|2|26283574||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Recent clinical studies show a positive correlation between elevated plasma levels of TMAO and an increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events defined as death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

29952796|ab|6|29952796|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Population-level data on NCD prevalence among PLHIV in SSA are sparse.
29952796|ab|7|29952796|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The review identified NCD screening and management approaches that could be integrated into HIV programs in SSA.
29952796|ab|8|29952796|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, few studies focused on the effectiveness, cost, and best practices for integrated chronic care platforms, making it difficult to derive policy recommendations.
29952796|ab|9|29952796|RESULTS|RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|To address these gaps, we propose a prioritized research agenda focused on developing evidence-based service delivery models, increasing human capacity through workforce education, generating data through informatics platforms and research, managing the medication supply chain, developing new financing and sustainability models, advancing research-informed policy, and addressing other crosscutting health system issues.
29952796|ab|10|29952796|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Based on collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts, a research agenda was developed to provide guidance that advances efforts to adapt the current health system to deliver integrated chronic care for PLHIV and the population at large.
17350653|ab|1|17350653||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Current advances in molecular biology enable us to access the rapidly increasing body of genetic information.
17350653|ab|2|17350653||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is still challenging to model gene systems at the molecular level.
17350653|ab|3|17350653||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|Here, we propose two types of reaction kinetic models for constructing genetic networks.
17350653|ab|4|17350653||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Time delays involved in transcription and translation are explicitly considered to explore the effects of delays, which may be significant in genetic networks featured with feedback loops.
17350653|ab|5|17350653||METHODS|METHODS|One type of model is based on delayed effective reactions, each reaction modeling a biochemical process like transcription without involving intermediate reactions.
17350653|ab|6|17350653||METHODS|METHODS|The other is based on delayed virtual reactions, each reaction being converted from a mathematical function to model a biochemical function like gene inhibition.
17350653|ab|7|17350653||METHODS|METHODS|The latter stochastic models are derived from the corresponding mean-field models.
17350653|ab|8|17350653||METHODS|METHODS|The former ones are composed of single gene expression modules.
17350653|ab|9|17350653||METHODS|METHODS|We thus design a model of gene expression.
17350653|ab|10|17350653||METHODS|METHODS|This model is verified by our simulations using a delayed stochastic simulation algorithm, which accurately reproduces the stochastic kinetics in a recent experimental study.
17350653|ab|11|17350653||METHODS|METHODS|Various simplified versions of the model are given and evaluated.
17350653|ab|12|17350653||METHODS|METHODS|We then use the two methods to study the genetic toggle switch and the repressilator.
17350653|ab|13|17350653||RESULTS|METHODS|We define the "on" and "off" states of genes and extract a binary code from the stochastic time series.
17350653|ab|14|17350653||CONCLUSIONS|METHODS|The binary code can be described by the corresponding Boolean network models in certain conditions.
17350653|ab|15|17350653||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|We discuss these conditions, suggesting a method to connect Boolean models, mean-field models, and stochastic chemical models.
29948607|ab|1|29948607|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Dealing with a child who suffers from functional abdominal pain (FAP) is a major challenge for the child's parents.
29948607|ab|2|29948607|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|However, little is known about the quality of life (QoL) of this group of parents.
29948607|ab|3|29948607|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of parental QoL among parents seeking treatment for their child's abdominal pain.
29948607|ab|4|29948607|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|133 parents of 7-13-year-old children diagnosed with FAP reported on their health-related QoL (HRQoL), as assessed by the SF-12, and on caregiver-related QoL, as assessed by two CHQ-PF50 scales (emotional impact, time impact).
29948607|ab|5|29948607|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|T tests were used to compare the parents' scores on these measures with reference scores.
29948607|ab|6|29948607|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Subgroups which were at risk of impairment were defined by cut-off scores.
29948607|ab|7|29948607|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Determinants of parental QoL were identified by hierarchical regression analyses.
29948607|ab|8|29948607|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|While the parents showed significantly poorer mental health compared to population-based reference samples (d = 0.33-0.58), their physical health did not differ.
29948607|ab|9|29948607|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, parents were severely strained with respect to the time impact and emotional impact of their child's health (d = 0.33-1.58).
29948607|ab|10|29948607|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|While 12.7-27.9% of the parents were at risk of poor HRQoL, 60.6-70.1% were highly strained due to the demands of their role as caregivers.
29948607|ab|11|29948607|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Physical and mental health were best explained by parents' psychiatric symptoms, while parents' perception of their child's impairment additionally determined the high time and emotional impact.
29948607|ab|12|29948607|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Physical HRQoL is not impaired in the majority of parents seeking treatment for their child's functional abdominal pain.
29948607|ab|13|29948607|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|However, the time demands and worries due to the child's pain deserve specific attention.
29948607|ab|14|29948607|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Psychosocial interventions for a child's FAP should include information provided to the parents about coping with time constraints and emotional impact.

18945655|ab|1|18945655||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The biomimetic reproduction of adhesion organs, as found in flies, beetles and geckoes, has become a topic of intense research over the past years.
18945655|ab|2|18945655||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Successes, however, have so far been limited.
18945655|ab|3|18945655||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|This is due to the vast range of parameters involved, including fibril size, elastic modulus, contact shape, surface roughness and ambient humidity.
18945655|ab|4|18945655||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In previous studies, design and materials selection charts to determine the optimum materials and design combination for dry adhesive systems have been established.
18945655|ab|5|18945655||CONCLUSIONS|BACKGROUND|The effect of shape on the adhesive properties of single fibers and fiber arrays has also been a research focus.
18945655|ab|6|18945655||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|In this paper both approaches are combined to provide more advanced guidelines for the design of optimal adhesive structures.
19472605|ab|1|19472605||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Breastmilk is the only dietary source of zinc for exclusively breastfed young infants, and it remains a potentially important source of zinc for older infants and young children who continue breastfeeding beyond early infancy.
19472605|ab|2|19472605||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Therefore, we examined available information on breastmilk zinc concentration and total milk consumption to develop estimates of the amount of zinc transferred in breastmilk to children of different ages.
19472605|ab|3|19472605||METHODS|RESULTS|Breastmilk zinc concentration declines rapidly during the first few months postpartum and more slowly thereafter.
19472605|ab|4|19472605||RESULTS|RESULTS|Breastmilk supplies all of the theoretical zinc needs for at least the first several months of life, although the period during which breastmilk alone remains sufficient is uncertain.
19472605|ab|5|19472605||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Breastmilk continues to provide more than half of children's estimated zinc requirements after the introduction of complementary foods, even into the second year of life.
19472605|ab|6|19472605||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Public health programs to promote and support breastfeeding should be included among the strategies to ensure adequate zinc status of young children.
29948498|ab|1|29948498|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Presentation of two typical cases with characteristic leopard retinopathy secondary to bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP) and idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome (IUES) and brief review of the literature about leopard spot retinopathy.
29948498|ab|2|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|A 43-year-old women, who was a known case of ovarian carcinoma, referred with gradual bilateral visual loss.
29948498|ab|3|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|In ophthalmic examination, subretinal fluid, multiple patchy subretinal hyperpigmented lesions and leopard spot chorioretinopathy were evident in her both eyes.
29948498|ab|4|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|Fluorescein angiography showed multiple nummular hyperfluorescent lesions surrounded by zones of hypofluorescence.
29948498|ab|5|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|Spectral domain optical coherence tomography revealed increased retinal thickness, subretinal fluid and RPE irregularities in both eyes.
29948498|ab|6|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|Enhanced depth imaging OCT (EDI-OCT) showed bilateral subfoveal choroidal thickening.
29948498|ab|7|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|During next 2-year follow-up, she underwent cataract surgery and later on developed neovascular glaucoma in her both eyes.
29948498|ab|8|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|The second case was a 45-year-old man who had developed decreased visual acuity in his left eye for 3 years.
29948498|ab|9|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|Anterior segment examination was unremarkable, and both eyes had normal intraocular pressure.
29948498|ab|10|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|No vitreous inflammation was observed.
29948498|ab|11|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|Fundoscopy revealed diffuse exudative retinal detachment in his left eye.
29948498|ab|12|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|Fluorescein angiography showed leopard spot retinopathy of posterior pole, and EDI-OCT disclosed subfoveal choroidal thickening.
29948498|ab|13|29948498|CASE REPORT|METHODS|METHODS|After exclusion of other causes of exudative retinal detachment and with diagnosis of IUES, he underwent intravitreal triamcinolone injection (2 mg) which improved his final vision to 20/40.
29948498|ab|14|29948498|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Leopard spot retinopathy is an uncommon but clinically distinct manifestation of various disorders.
29948498|ab|15|29948498|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|BDUMP may present with leopard spot retinopathy, anterior uveal tract involvement and neovascular glaucoma.
29948498|ab|16|29948498|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|As EDI-OCT showed involvement and increased thickening of choroid in both cases of BDUMP and IUES, it may be better to consider such cases as leopard chorioretinopathy and categorize these entities as a member of pachychoroid pigment retinopathy disorders.
29877740|ab|1|29877740|RATIONALE|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The reliability of using between-visit variation in FEV1 to diagnose asthma is understudied, and hence uncertain.
29877740|ab|2|29877740|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To determine if FEV1 variability measured over recurrent visits is significantly associated with a diagnosis of current asthma.
29877740|ab|3|29877740|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Randomly-selected adults (N=964) with a history of physician-diagnosed asthma were studied from 2005-2007 and from 2012-2016.
29877740|ab|4|29877740|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A diagnosis of current asthma was confirmed in those participants who exhibited bronchial hyper-responsiveness to methacholine and/or acute worsening of asthma symptoms while being weaned off asthma medications.
29877740|ab|5|29877740|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Regression analyses and receiver operating curves were used to evaluate the ability of between-visit FEV1 variability to diagnose asthma.
29877740|ab|6|29877740|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A current diagnosis of asthma was confirmed in 584 of 964 participants (60%).
29877740|ab|7|29877740|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Between-visit absolute variability in FEV1 was significantly greater in those in whom current asthma was confirmed, compared to those in whom current asthma was ruled out (7.3% vs 4.8%, mean difference between the 2 groups = 2.5%; 95% CI: 1.7-3.3%).
29877740|ab|8|29877740|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, a 12 percent and 200 mL between-visit variation in FEV1, which is the diagnostic threshold recommended by GINA, exhibited a sensitivity of only 0.17 and a specificity of 0.94 for confirming current asthma.
29877740|ab|9|29877740|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A between-visit absolute variability in FEV1 >/= 12% and 200 ml increased the pre-test probability of asthma from 60% to a post-test probability of 81%.
29877740|ab|10|29877740|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|A 12% and 200 mL between-visit variation in FEV1, if present, has reasonably good specificity for diagnosing asthma, but has poor sensitivity compared to bronchial challenge testing.
29877740|ab|11|29877740|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Between-visit variability in FEV1 is a relatively unhelpful test to establish a diagnosis of asthma.

29898372|ab|1|29898372|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Despite evidence highlighting the importance of the forearm flexor muscles of elite baseball players, no studies have reported on the epidemiology of flexor strains and their associated outcomes.
29898372|ab|2|29898372|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To examine the incidence, associated injuries, and outcomes associated with forearm flexor injuries among major and minor league baseball players.

29898372|ab|4|29898372|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Injury data attributed to forearm flexor injuries among Major League Baseball (MLB) and minor league teams between 2010 and 2014 were obtained from the professional baseball Health and Injury Tracking System.
29898372|ab|5|29898372|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This analysis included the number of players injured, seasonal timing of injury, days spent on the disabled list (DL), preinjury performance data, and subsequent injuries.
29898372|ab|6|29898372|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A total of 134 and 629 forearm flexor injuries occurred in MLB and the minor leagues, respectively.
29898372|ab|7|29898372|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean player age was 28.6 and 22.8 years in the MLB and minor leagues, respectively.
29898372|ab|8|29898372|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean time spent on the DL for MLB players was 117.0 days, as opposed to 93.9 days in the minor leagues ( P = .272).
29898372|ab|9|29898372|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Interestingly, pitcher performance declined in all categories examined leading up to the season of injury, with significant differences in walks plus hits per inning pitched ( P = .04) and strike percentage ( P = .036).
29898372|ab|10|29898372|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Of MLB players with a forearm injury, subsequent injuries included 50 (37.3%) shoulder, 48 (35.8%) elbow, and 24 (17.9%) forearm injuries.

26086108|ab|1|26086108||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Vascular pathologies are associated with changes in the presence and expression of morphologically distinct vascular smooth muscle cells.
26086108|ab|2|26086108||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In particular, in complex human vascular lesions and models of disease in pigs and rodents, an intimal smooth muscle cell (iSMC) which exhibits a stable epithelioid or rhomboid phenotype in culture is often found to be present in high numbers, and may represent the reemergence of a distinct developmental vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype.
26086108|ab|3|26086108||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The CYP450-oxylipin - soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) pathway is currently of great interest in targeting for cardiovascular disease.
26086108|ab|4|26086108||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|sEH inhibitors limit the development of hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis and aneurysm formation in animal models.
26086108|ab|5|26086108||METHODS|METHODS|We have investigated the expression of CYP450-oxylipin-sEH pathway enzymes and their metabolites in paired intimal (iSMC) and medial (mSMC) cells isolated from rat aorta.
26086108|ab|6|26086108||RESULTS|RESULTS|iSMC basally released significantly larger amounts of epoxy-oxylipin CYP450 products from eicosapentaenoic acid > docosahexaenoic acid > arachidonic acid > linoleic acid, and expressed higher levels of CYP2C12, CYP2B1, but not CYP2J mRNA compared to mSMC.
26086108|ab|7|26086108||RESULTS|RESULTS|When stimulated with the pro-inflammatory TLR4 ligand LPS, epoxy-oxylipin production did not change greatly in iSMC.
26086108|ab|8|26086108||RESULTS|RESULTS|In contrast, LPS induced epoxy-oxylipin products in mSMC and induced CYP2J4.
26086108|ab|9|26086108||RESULTS|RESULTS|iSMC and mSMC express sEH which metabolizes primary epoxy-oxylipins to their dihydroxy-counterparts.
26086108|ab|10|26086108||RESULTS|RESULTS|The sEH inhibitors TPPU or AUDA inhibited LPS-induced NFkappaB activation and iNOS induction in mSMC, but had no effect on NFkappaB nuclear localization or inducible nitric oxide synthase in iSMC; effects which were recapitulated in part by addition of authentic epoxy-oxylipins.
26086108|ab|11|26086108||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|iSMCs are a rich source but not a sensor of anti-inflammatory epoxy-oxylipins.
26086108|ab|12|26086108||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Complex lesions that contain high levels of iSMCs may be more resistant to the protective effects of sEH inhibitors.

26038428|ab|1|26038428||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Shigella flexneri is a leading cause of bacterial dysentery in developing countries.
26038428|ab|2|26038428||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Among the 15 known serotypes, four (1b, 3a, 3b and 4b) contain a group 6 epitope due to an acetyl group connected to the O-2 position of rhamnose III on the tetrasaccharide structure of the lipopolysaccharide.
26038428|ab|3|26038428||METHODS|BACKGROUND|O-acetyltransferase encoded by a bacteriophage, Sf6, mediates the acetylation reaction.
26038428|ab|4|26038428||RESULTS|RESULTS|We found that the oac gene in serotype 1b strains was very different from that in serotypes 3a, 3b and 4b strains and is herein after referred to as oac 1b which shares with oac 88%-89% identity at the DNA level and 85% identity at the protein level.
26038428|ab|5|26038428||RESULTS|RESULTS|Considering that S. flexneri strains of serotypes 1-5 share a recent common ancestry, the divergent oac 1b is more likely to have been obtained from outside S. flexneri than to have undergone rapid divergence from the oac gene in the other serotypes (3a, 3b and 4b) within S. flexneri.
26038428|ab|6|26038428||RESULTS|RESULTS|The cloned oac 1b gene was found to perform the same acetylation function as oac.
26038428|ab|7|26038428||RESULTS|RESULTS|Analysis of the genomic regions flanking oac 1b showed that it was present in a prophage on the chromosome and the organizational structure is different from that of phage Sf6.

21423523|ab|1|21423523||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|A computationally rich algorithm of synaptic plasticity has been proposed based on the experimental observation that the sign and amplitude of the change in synaptic weight is dictated by the temporal order and temporal contiguity between pre- and postsynaptic activities.
21423523|ab|2|21423523||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|For more than a decade, this spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has been studied mainly in brain slices of different brain structures and cultured neurons.
21423523|ab|3|21423523||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although not yet compelling, evidences for the STDP rule in the intact brain, including primary sensory cortices, have been provided lastly.
21423523|ab|4|21423523||RESULTS|RESULTS|From insects to mammals, the presentation of precisely timed sensory inputs drives synaptic and functional plasticity in the intact central nervous system, with similar timing requirements than the in vitro defined STDP rule.
21423523|ab|5|21423523||RESULTS|RESULTS|The convergent evolution of this plasticity rule in species belonging to so distant phylogenic groups points to the efficiency of STDP, as a mechanism for modifying synaptic weights, as the basis of activity-dependent development, learning and memory.
21423523|ab|6|21423523||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In spite of the ubiquity of STDP phenomena, a number of significant variations of the rule are observed in different structures, neuronal types and even synapses on the same neuron, as well as between in vitro and in vivo conditions.
21423523|ab|7|21423523||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In addition, the state of the neuronal network, its ongoing activity and the activation of ascending neuromodulatory systems in different behavioral conditions have dramatic consequences on the expression of spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity, and should be further explored.
24502923|ab|1|24502923||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) have the ability to divide or to growth arrest and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes in the developing brain.
24502923|ab|2|24502923||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Due to their high number and the persistence of their proliferative capacity in the adult brain, OPCs are being studied as potential targets for myelin repair and also as a potential source of brain tumors.
24502923|ab|3|24502923||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study addresses the molecular mechanisms regulating the transcriptional changes occurring at the critical transition between proliferation and cell cycle exit in cultured OPCs.
24502923|ab|4|24502923||METHODS|METHODS|Using bioinformatic analysis of existing datasets, we identified c-Myc as a key transcriptional regulator of this transition and confirmed direct binding of this transcription factor to identified target genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation.
24502923|ab|5|24502923||RESULTS|RESULTS|The expression of c-Myc was elevated in proliferating OPCs, where it also bound to the promoter of genes involved in cell cycle regulation (i.e. Cdc2) or chromosome organization (i.e. H2afz).
24502923|ab|6|24502923||RESULTS|RESULTS|Silencing of c-Myc was associated with decreased histone acetylation at target gene promoters and consequent decrease of gene transcripts. c-Myc silencing also induced a global increase of repressive histone methylation and premature peripheral nuclear chromatin compaction while promoting the progression towards differentiation.
24502923|ab|7|24502923||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We conclude that c-Myc is an important modulator of the transition between proliferation and differentiation of OPCs, although its decrease is not sufficient to induce progression into a myelinating phenotype.
25114527|ab|1|25114527||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The potential of boron-containing lipids with three different structures, which were intended for use in boron neutron capture therapy, was investigated.
25114527|ab|2|25114527||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|All three types of boron lipids contained the anionic dodecaborate cluster as the headgroup.
25114527|ab|3|25114527||METHODS|METHODS|Their effects on two different tumor models in mice following intravenous injection were tested; for this, liposomes with boron lipid, distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol as helper lipids, and containing a polyethylene glycol lipid for steric protection, were administered intravenously into tumor-bearing mice (C3H mice for SCCVII squamous cell carcinoma and BALB/c mice for CT26/WT colon carcinoma).
25114527|ab|4|25114527||RESULTS|RESULTS|With the exception of one lipid (B-THF-14), the lipids were well tolerated, and no other animal was lost due to systemic toxicity.
25114527|ab|5|25114527||RESULTS|RESULTS|The lipid which led to death was not found to be much more toxic in cell culture than the other boron lipids.
25114527|ab|6|25114527||RESULTS|RESULTS|All of the lipids that were well tolerated showed hemorrhage in both tumor models within a few hours after administration.
25114527|ab|7|25114527||RESULTS|RESULTS|The hemorrhage could be seen by in vivo magnetic resonance and histology, and was found to occur within a few hours.
25114527|ab|8|25114527||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The degree of hemorrhage depended on the amount of boron administered and on the tumor model.
25114527|ab|9|25114527||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The observed unwanted effect of the lipids precludes their use in boron neutron capture therapy.
27403247|ab|1|27403247||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|A two-day-old male neonate was inadvertently immunized with 20-times the recommended dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine (1.0 ml instead of 0.05 ml).
27403247|ab|2|27403247||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Examination of the neonate after one day revealed no signs of local reaction at the site of injection or systemic manifestation.
27403247|ab|3|27403247||METHODS|RESULTS|However, nine days later, he developed a swelling (4 x 3 cm) at the site of injection without any enlargement of the lymph node, pallor, or jaundice.
27403247|ab|4|27403247||RESULTS|METHODS|A needle aspiration of the swelling was done and sent for culture.
27403247|ab|5|27403247||RESULTS|RESULTS|The culture showed the BCG strain only.
27403247|ab|6|27403247||RESULTS|RESULTS|The infant was not started on antituberculosis medication, due to the absence of symptoms suggestive of systemic disease.
27403247|ab|7|27403247||RESULTS|RESULTS|There were no other complications up to the age of 18 months.
27403247|ab|8|27403247||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The case highlights the importance of administering the correct dose and using the appropriate technique of the BCG vaccine, and explains the management options to prevent local and systematic complications that may occur due to overdose.
28422004|ab|1|28422004||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|International case definitions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) are commonly used for influenza surveillance.

28422004|ab|3|28422004||METHODS|RESULTS|Cough and fever >/= 39 degrees C most accurately predicted an influenza infection in all age groups.
28422004|ab|4|28422004||RESULTS|RESULTS|Several other symptoms were associated with an increased risk of influenza (headache, weakness, myalgia, coryza) or decreased risk (adenopathy, pharyngitis, shortness of breath, otitis/otalgia, bronchitis/ bronchiolitis), but not throughout all age groups.
28422004|ab|5|28422004||RESULTS|RESULTS|The WHO case definition for influenza-like illness (ILI) had the highest specificity with 21.4%, while the ECDC ILI case definition had the highest sensitivity with 96.1%.

28422004|ab|7|28422004||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The study compared the performance of clinical influenza definitions based on outpatient surveillance and will contribute to improving the comparability of data shared at international level.
18639469|ab|1|18639469||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Cognitive models of reading predict that high frequency regular words can be read in more than one way.
18639469|ab|2|18639469||OBJECTIVE|METHODS|We investigated this hypothesis using functional MRI and covariance analysis in 43 healthy skilled readers.
18639469|ab|3|18639469||METHODS|RESULTS|Our results dissociated two sets of regions that were differentially engaged across subjects who were reading the same familiar words.
18639469|ab|4|18639469||RESULTS|RESULTS|Some subjects showed more activation in left inferior frontal and anterior occipito-temporal regions while other subjects showed more activation in right inferior parietal and left posterior occipito-temporal regions.
18639469|ab|5|18639469||OBJECTIVE|METHODS|To explore the behavioural correlates of these systems, we measured the difference between reading speed for irregularly spelled words relative to pseudowords outside the scanner in fifteen of our subjects and correlated this measure with fMRI activation for reading familiar words.
18639469|ab|6|18639469||RESULTS|RESULTS|The faster the lexical reading the greater the activation in left posterior occipito-temporal and right inferior parietal regions.
18639469|ab|7|18639469||RESULTS|RESULTS|Conversely, the slower the lexical reading the greater the activation in left anterior occipito-temporal and left ventral inferior frontal regions.
18639469|ab|8|18639469||RESULTS|CONCLUSIONS|Thus, the double dissociation in irregular and pseudoword reading behaviour predicted the double dissociation in neuronal activation for reading familiar words.
18639469|ab|9|18639469||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We discuss the implications of these results which may be important for understanding how reading is learnt in childhood or re-learnt following brain damage in adulthood.
29953695|ab|1|29953695|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Supporting an adult with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be associated with family stress but also with personal growth and resilience.
29953695|ab|2|29953695|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Research providing insight into how typically developing siblings make sense of their unique sibling relationships in adulthood remains limited.
29953695|ab|3|29953695|METHOD|METHODS|OBJECTIVE|Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, this study explored subjective experiences of eight siblings of adults with ASD and co-occurring intellectual disability.
29953695|ab|4|29953695|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Analysis of interview transcripts revealed a complex lived experience explained by the overarching theme "engaging with and navigating limbo", which was characterized by commitment to the sibling relationship, power tensions in the family, uncertainty about the future and negotiating the tension between relational closeness and distance.
29953695|ab|5|29953695|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|Using family systems theory, overregulation and closed communication emerged as processes relevant to families living with ASD.

29954254|ab|1|29954254|CONTEXT|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although uterine fibroids (UFs) continue to place a major burden on female reproductive health, the mechanisms behind their origin remain undetermined.
29954254|ab|2|29954254|CONTEXT|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Normal myometrial stem cells may be transformed into tumor-initiating stem cells, causing UFs, due to unknown causes of somatic mutations in MED12, found in up to 85% of sporadically formed UFs.
29954254|ab|3|29954254|CONTEXT|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is well established in other tumor types that defective DNA repair increases the risk of such tumorigenic somatic mutations, mechanisms not yet studied in UFs.
29954254|ab|4|29954254|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To examine the putative cause(s) of this stem cell transformation, we analyzed DNA repair within stem cells from human UFs compared to those from adjacent myometrium to determine whether DNA repair in fibroid stem cells is compromised.
29954254|ab|5|29954254|DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|Human fibroid (F) and adjacent myometrial (Myo) stem cells were isolated from fresh tissues, and gene expression relating to DNA repair was analyzed.
29954254|ab|6|29954254|DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|Fibroid stem cells differentially expressed DNA repair genes related to DNA double- (DSBs) and single-strand breaks.
29954254|ab|7|29954254|DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|DNA damage was measured using alkaline comet assay.

29957864|ab|2|29957864|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We sought to investigate patterns of 90-day readmission after hepato-pancreatic (HP) procedures.
29957864|ab|3|29957864|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) was used to identify patients undergoing HP procedures between 2010 and 2014.
29957864|ab|4|29957864|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patients were stratified according to benign versus malignant HP diagnoses and as index (same hospital as operation) versus non-index (different hospital) readmissions.

21325707|ab|1|21325707||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In computed tomography there are different situations where reconstruction has to be performed with limited raw data.
21325707|ab|2|21325707||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In the past few years it has been shown that algorithms which are based on compressed sensing theory are able to handle incomplete datasets quite well.
21325707|ab|3|21325707||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|As a cost function these algorithms use the l(1)-norm of the image after it has been transformed by a sparsifying transformation.
21325707|ab|4|21325707||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|This yields to an inequality-constrained convex optimization problem.
21325707|ab|5|21325707||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Due to the large size of the optimization problem some heuristic optimization algorithms have been proposed in the past few years.
21325707|ab|6|21325707||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The most popular way is optimizing the raw data and sparsity cost functions separately in an alternating manner.
21325707|ab|7|21325707||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In this paper we will follow this strategy and present a new method to adapt these optimization steps.
21325707|ab|8|21325707||RESULTS|METHODS|Compared to existing methods which perform similarly, the proposed method needs no a priori knowledge about the raw data consistency.
21325707|ab|9|21325707||RESULTS|METHODS|It is ensured that the algorithm converges to the lowest possible value of the raw data cost function, while holding the sparsity constraint at a low value.
21325707|ab|10|21325707||METHODS|METHODS|This is achieved by transferring the step-size determination of both optimization procedures into the raw data domain, where they are adapted to each other.
21325707|ab|11|21325707||METHODS|METHODS|To evaluate the algorithm, we process measured clinical datasets.
21325707|ab|12|21325707||METHODS|METHODS|To cover a wide field of possible applications, we focus on the problems of angular undersampling, data lost due to metal implants, limited view angle tomography and interior tomography.
21325707|ab|13|21325707||RESULTS|RESULTS|In all cases the presented method reaches convergence within less than 25 iteration steps, while using a constant set of algorithm control parameters.
21325707|ab|14|21325707||RESULTS|RESULTS|The image artifacts caused by incomplete raw data are mostly removed without introducing new effects like staircasing.
21325707|ab|15|21325707||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|All scenarios are compared to an existing implementation of the ASD-POCS algorithm, which realizes the step-size adaption in a different way.
21325707|ab|16|21325707||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Additional prior information as proposed by the PICCS algorithm can be incorporated easily into the optimization process.

29889725|ab|1|29889725|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Continuous video electroencephalographic (EEG) (cvEEG) monitoring is emerging as the standard of care for diagnosis and management of neonatal seizures.
29889725|ab|2|29889725|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, cvEEG is labor-intensive and the need to initiate and interpret studies on a 24-hour basis is a major limitation.
29889725|ab|3|29889725|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study aims at establishing consistency in monitoring of newborns admitted to 2 different neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) managed by the same neurocritical care team.

23589619|ab|1|23589619||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Lysis of RBCs during numerous clinical settings such as severe hemolytic anemia, infection, tissue injury, or blood transfusion releases the endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern, hemoglobin (Hb), into the plasma.
23589619|ab|2|23589619||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The redox-reactive Hb generates cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, disrupting the redox balance and impairing the immune-responsive blood cells.
23589619|ab|3|23589619||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|Therefore, it is crucial to understand how the immune system defends against the cytotoxic Hb.
23589619|ab|4|23589619||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|We identified a shortcut "capture and quench" mechanism of detoxification of Hb by the monocyte scavenger receptor CD163, independent of the well-known dominant antioxidant, haptoglobin.
23589619|ab|5|23589619||RESULTS|RESULTS|Our findings support a highly efficient two-pass mechanism of detoxification and clearance of Hb: 1) a direct suppression of Hb-pseudoperoxidase activity by CD163, involving an autocrine loop of CD163 shedding, sequestration of Hb, recycling, and homeostasis of CD163 in human monocytes and 2) paracrine transactivation of endothelial cells by the shedded soluble CD163 (sCD163), which further detoxifies and clears residual Hb.
23589619|ab|6|23589619||RESULTS|RESULTS|We showed that sCD163 and IgG interact with free Hb in the plasma and subsequently the sCD163-Hb-IgG complex is endocytosed into monocytes via FcgammaR.
23589619|ab|7|23589619||RESULTS|RESULTS|The endocytosed sCD163 is recycled to restore the homeostasis of CD163 on the monocyte membrane in an autocrine cycle, whereas the internalized Hb is catabolized.
23589619|ab|8|23589619||RESULTS|RESULTS|Using ex vivo coculture experiments, we demonstrated that the monocyte-derived sCD163 and IgG shuttle residual plasma Hb into the proximal endothelial cells.
23589619|ab|9|23589619||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings suggest that CD163 and IgG collaborate to engage monocytes and endothelial cells in a two-pass detoxification mechanism to mount a systemic defense against Hb-induced oxidative stress.

19572309|ab|3|19572309||METHODS|RESULTS|The embryos of C. orientalis most closely resemble those of stage 47/48 Gegeneophis ramaswamii, an Indian caeciliid, and stage 47/48 Hypogeophis rostratus, a Seychellian caeciliid, both direct developers, in details of bone mineralization, chondrocranial degeneration, and vertebrogenesis.
19572309|ab|4|19572309||RESULTS|RESULTS|They are most like stage 45 H. rostratus in external features (gills, pigmentation, etc.).
19572309|ab|5|19572309||RESULTS|RESULTS|They are less similar to prehatchings of Ichthyophis kohtaoensis, an ichthyophiid with free-living larvae, and to fetuses of the viviparous caeciliid Dermophis mexicanus and the viviparous typhlonectid Typhlonectes compressicauda at comparable total lengths in both skeletal development and external features.
19572309|ab|6|19572309||RESULTS|RESULTS|The similarity of developmental features among the direct-developers suggests a correlation with mode of life history.
19572309|ab|7|19572309||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|A noteworthy feature is that C. orientalis has an armature of multiple rows of teeth on the lower jaw with tooth crowns that resemble the "fetal" teeth of viviparous taxa and that are covered with a layer of oral mucosal epithelium until full development and eruption, but the upper jaw bears a single row of widely spaced, elongate, slightly recurved teeth that resemble those of the adult.

29929633|ab|6|29929633|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean age and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS PROM) scores were significantly higher in patients with TMVR than in those with SMVR (age 74.9 +/- 9.4 years vs. 63.7 +/- 14.9 years; p < 0.001; STS PROM 12.7 +/- 8.0% vs. 8.7 +/- 10.1%; p < 0.0001).
29929633|ab|7|29929633|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Total procedure time, intensive care unit hours, and post-procedure length of stay were all significantly shorter in the TMVR group.
29929633|ab|8|29929633|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was no difference in mortality at 1 year between the 2 groups (TMVR 11.3% vs. SMVR 11.9%; p = 0.92).
29929633|ab|9|29929633|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean mitral valve pressure gradient and the grade of mitral regurgitation (MR) were similar between the TMVR group and the SMVR group (mitral valve pressure gradient 7.1 +/- 2.5 mm Hg vs. 6.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg; p = 0.42; MR [>/=moderate] 3.8% vs. 5.6%; p = 1.00) at 30 days.
29929633|ab|10|29929633|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|At 1 year, the mitral valve pressure gradient was higher in the TMVR group (TMVR 7.2 +/- 2.7 vs. SMVR 5.5 +/- 1.8; p = 0.01), although there was no difference in the grade of MR.
29929633|ab|11|29929633|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Despite the higher STS PROM in TMVR patients, there was no difference in 1-year mortality between the TMVR and SMVR groups.
29929633|ab|12|29929633|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Echocardiographic findings after TMVR were similar to SMVR at 30 days.
29929633|ab|13|29929633|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|There was a statistically significant difference in mitral gradient at 1 year, though this is likely not clinically important.
29929633|ab|14|29929633|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|TMVR may be an alternative to SMVR in patients with previous mitral bioprosthetic valves.

24056541|ab|2|24056541||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is thus quite well known that, among other compounds, potato is rich in polyphenols, vitamins and in some minerals.
24056541|ab|3|24056541||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This paper underlines the important role of simulated gastro-intestinal in vitro digestion in the bioaccessibility of polyphenols (chlorogenic acid and derivatives, and rutin) from potatoes and sweet potatoes and their impact on iron uptake.
24056541|ab|4|24056541||METHODS|METHODS|Concentrations of polyphenols in the flesh of two potato cultivars (Nicola, white potato, and Vitelotte, purple potato) and sweet potato were measured by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography after boiling and after in vitro digestion.
24056541|ab|5|24056541||RESULTS|RESULTS|Chemical extraction underestimates polyphenol amounts that can be released during digestion and that are actually bioaccessible.
24056541|ab|6|24056541||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Iron uptake, as evaluated by a ferritin assay, by intestinal human cells was decreased after incubation with the intestinal phase of in vitro digestion, presumably due to the presence of polyphenols.
27041384|ab|1|27041384||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Patients with severely elevated creatine kinase (CK) concentrations are commonly referred to rheumatologists to evaluate for the presence of an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM).

24903516|ab|2|24903516||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|We have for years organized knowledge on transcriptional regulation reported in the original literature of Escherichia coli K-12 into RegulonDB (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx), our database that is currently supported by >5000 papers.
24903516|ab|3|24903516||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Here, we report a first step towards the automatic biocuration of growth conditions in this corpus.
24903516|ab|4|24903516||METHODS|METHODS|Using the OntoGene text-mining system (http://www.ontogene.org), we extracted and manually validated regulatory interactions and growth conditions in a new approach based on filters that enable the curator to select informative sentences from preprocessed full papers.

27702654|ab|1|27702654||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Type 2 diabetes mellitus impairs osteogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs).
27702654|ab|2|27702654||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) has been extensively applied for bone defect restoration and has been shown to activate the Wnt signaling pathway.
27702654|ab|3|27702654||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of BMP2 on the cell proliferation and osteogenesis of type 2 diabetic BMSCs in rats and explore whether BMP2 induced osteogenesis via the stimulation of Wnt signaling pathway.
27702654|ab|4|27702654||METHODS|METHODS|The cell experiments were divided into DM (diabetic BMSCs), BMP25 (induced with 25ng/ml BMP2), BMP100 (induced with 100ng/ml BMP2) and BMP25 +XAV groups.
27702654|ab|5|27702654||METHODS|METHODS|All cells with or without the different concentrations of BMP2 were cultured under the same experimental conditions.
27702654|ab|6|27702654||RESULTS|RESULTS|The in vitro results indicated that BMP2 enhanced cell proliferation by 130%-157% and osteogenic differentiation by approximately two-fold in type 2 diabetic BMSCs.
27702654|ab|7|27702654||RESULTS|RESULTS|The expression levels of beta-catenin, cyclin D1, Runx2 and c-myc related to the Wnt signaling pathway were also upregulated from 180% to 212% in BMP2-induced type 2 diabetic rat BMSCs, while the level of GSK3beta decreased to 43%.
27702654|ab|8|27702654||RESULTS|RESULTS|In BMP2-induced type 2 diabetic BMSCs with calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds for osteoblast study in vivo, the appearance of newly formed bone dramatically increased to 175% compared with type 2 diabetic BMSCs.
27702654|ab|9|27702654||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These data demonstrated that BMP2 enhanced bone regeneration in diabetic BMSCs by stimulating the Wnt signaling pathway with the accumulation of beta-catenin and the depressed expression of GSK3beta.
27702654|ab|10|27702654||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Diabetic BMSCs associated with BMP2 might be a potential tissue-engineered construct for bone defects in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

29921540|ab|3|29921540|DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|The cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2017 to May 2017.
29921540|ab|4|29921540|PARTICIPANTS/SETTING|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 372 low-income older adults, 60 years of age and older, living in the state of Alabama participated.
29921540|ab|5|29921540|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES|METHODS|METHODS|Participants completed a validated survey measuring food insecurity (six-item US Food Security Survey Module), self-care capacity (Self-Care Capacity Scale), depressive symptoms (10-item Geriatric Depression Scale), and nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form).
29921540|ab|6|29921540|STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED|METHODS|METHODS|Generalized structural equation modeling was used to include the simultaneous equations and multiple mediators in one model.
29921540|ab|7|29921540|STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED|METHODS|METHODS|The Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, and likelihood ratio tests were conducted to compare the fit of competing model specifications.
29921540|ab|8|29921540|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Lower self-care capacity was associated with greater food insecurity (beta [b]=.11, odds ratio [OR]=1.11, P=0.03) and higher depressive symptoms (b=.08, P=0.005).
29921540|ab|9|29921540|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Poorer self-care capacity and higher depressive symptoms were associated with poorer nutritional status (b=.24, OR=1.27, P<0.001; b=.13, OR=1.43, P=0.001, respectively).
29921540|ab|10|29921540|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Higher food insecurity was associated with increased depressive symptoms (b=.40, P<0.001).
29921540|ab|11|29921540|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Self-care capacity was associated with nutritional status directly and indirectly through depressive symptoms (b=.04, P=0.048).
29921540|ab|12|29921540|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Although food insecurity was not significantly associated with nutritional status, a significant indirect association between food insecurity and nutritional status through depressive symptoms was observed (b=.02, P=0.04).
29921540|ab|13|29921540|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Study results indicate functionally impaired low-income older adults encounter greater food insecurity.
29921540|ab|14|29921540|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Inability to afford food combined with limited ability to take care of oneself contributes to an increased self-report of depressive symptoms, resulting in less favorable nutritional status.
29949196|ab|1|29949196|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The role of underlying genetic factors in the pathogenesis of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (NSOC) remains poorly understood.
29949196|ab|2|29949196|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although genomewide association studies (GWASs) of NSOC have successfully identified a large number of novel genetic risk loci, association results of replication studies are inconsistent across different populations.
29949196|ab|3|29949196|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7922405 at 10q26.3, rs73039426 at 19q13.11, rs7552 at 2p24.2, rs1788160 at 8q22.2, rs9381107 at 6p24.3, and rs17095681 at 10q25.3) were analyzed for an association with NSOC in 1062 participants of Chinese descent (596 patients and 466 controls).
29949196|ab|4|29949196|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We applied the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method to detect potential gene-gene (G x G) interactions in the six SNPs.
29949196|ab|5|29949196|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The genotype or allele frequencies of SNPs rs7922405, rs73039426, and rs7552 showed significant differences between the controls and patients with NSOC, whereas no association was shown between three SNPs (rs1788160, rs17095681, and rs9381107) and NSOC.
29949196|ab|6|29949196|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|MDR analysis did not reveal significant G x G interactions for susceptibility to NSOC.
29949196|ab|7|29949196|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We confirmed that three genes (rs7922405 of MGMT, rs73039426 of RHPN2, and rs7552 of FAM49A) may contribute to NSOC in Chinese populations.
29949196|ab|8|29949196|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|MGMT and RHPN2 are associated with NSOC, which is herein demonstrated for the first time.

25732082|ab|1|25732082||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Worldwide populations are aging and countries have to prepare for the effects of demographic change in health care.
25732082|ab|2|25732082||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Health information exchange (HIE), which is the process of moving patient information across health care providers electronically, can help overcome health data fragmentation and open opportunities to improve patient care in terms of quality, economy and efficiency.
25732082|ab|3|25732082||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Since Japan and Germany are among the first countries strongly impacted by demographic changes of aging populations, we report on current developments about health information systems carrying out HIE based on case studies in both countries.
25732082|ab|4|25732082||METHODS|METHODS|Four projects that address the improvement of HIE within a defined region have been selected and investigated: the German project of the Lower Saxony Bank of Health and the Japanese projects Chiba ITnet, Nagasaki AjisaiNet and the National Disaster and Backup System of Japan.
25732082|ab|5|25732082||RESULTS|RESULTS|The project descriptions are based on relevant English publications, on-site visits and interviews with developers and users.

29954636|ab|1|29954636|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Previous studies have shown that a subgroup of children with suspected (central) auditory processing disorder (SusCAPD) have insufficient ability to use binaural cues to benefit from spatial processing.
29954636|ab|2|29954636|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Thus, they experience considerable listening difficulties in challenging auditory environments, such as classrooms.
29954636|ab|3|29954636|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Some researchers have also indicated the probable role of binaural temporal fine structure (TFS) in the perceptual segregation of target signal from noise and hence in speech perception in noise.
29954636|ab|4|29954636|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Therefore, in the present study, in order to further investigate the underlying reason for listening problems against background noise in this group of children, their performance was measured using binaural TFS sensitivity test (TFS-LF) as well as behavioral auditory lateralization in noise test, both of which are based on binaural temporal cues processing.
29954636|ab|5|29954636|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Participants in this analytical study included 91 children with normal hearing and no listening problems and 41 children (9-12 years old) with SusCAPD who found it challenging to understand speech in noise.
29954636|ab|6|29954636|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Initially, the ability to use binaural TFS was measured at three frequencies (250, 500 and 750Hz) in both the groups, and the results of preliminary evaluations were compared between normal children and those with SusCAPD who participated in the study.
29954636|ab|7|29954636|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Thereafter, the binaural performance of the 16 children with SusCAPD who had higher thresholds than the normal group at all three frequencies tested in TFS-LF test was examined using the lateralization test in 7 spatial locations.
29954636|ab|8|29954636|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Total 16 of the 41 children with SusCAPD who participated in this study (39%) showed poor performance on the TFS-LF test at all three frequencies, compared to both normal children and other children in the APD group (p<0.05).
29954636|ab|9|29954636|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, children in the APD group with binaural TFS coding deficits at all three frequencies revealed significant differences in the lateralization test results compared to normal children (p<0.05).
29954636|ab|10|29954636|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Findings of the current study demonstrated that one of the underlying causes for the difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments experienced by a subgroup of children with SusCAPD can be the reduced ability to benefit from binaural TFS information.
29954636|ab|11|29954636|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This study also showed that a reduced ability to use binaural TFS cues in the group of children with SusCAPD was accompanied by reduced binaural processing abilities in the lateralization test which also admit the presence of binaural temporal processing deficits in this group of children.

24582836|ab|1|24582836||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The mutagenic effect of hepatitis B (HBV) integration in predisposing risk to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive.
24582836|ab|2|24582836||BACKGROUND|METHODS|In this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing of HBV-positive HCC cell lines and showed transcription of viral-human gene fusions from the site of genome integrations.
24582836|ab|3|24582836||METHODS|RESULTS|We discovered tumor-promoting properties of a chimeric HBx-LINE1 that, intriguingly, functions as a hybrid RNA.
24582836|ab|4|24582836||RESULTS|RESULTS|HBx-LINE1 can be detected in 23.3% of HBV-associated HCC tumors and correlates with poorer patient survival.
24582836|ab|5|24582836||RESULTS|RESULTS|HBx-LINE1 transgenic mice showed heightened susceptibility to diethylnitrosamine-induced tumor formation.
24582836|ab|6|24582836||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We further show that HBx-LINE1 expression affects beta-catenin transactivity, which underlines a role in activating Wnt signaling.
24582836|ab|7|24582836||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Thus, this study identifies a viral-human chimeric fusion transcript that functions like a long noncoding RNA to promote HCC.
29881987|ab|1|29881987|RATIONALE|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The standard of care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been developed based on studies that usually excluded patients with major comorbidities.
29881987|ab|2|29881987|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To describe treatments and outcomes according to comorbidities in patients with ARDS admitted to 19 ICUs (1997-2014).
29881987|ab|3|29881987|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patients were grouped based on comorbidities.
29881987|ab|4|29881987|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Determinants of day-28 mortality were identified by multivariable Cox analysis stratified on center.
29881987|ab|5|29881987|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Among 4953 ARDS patients, 2545 (51.4%) had major comorbidities; the proportion with major comorbidities increased after 2008.
29881987|ab|6|29881987|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Hematological malignancy was associated with severe ARDS and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia.
29881987|ab|7|29881987|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|COPD, HIV infection, and hematological malignancy were associated with a lower likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation on the admission day.
29881987|ab|8|29881987|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Admission-day SOFA score was higher in patients with major comorbidities, who more often received vasopressors, dialysis, or treatment-limitation decisions.
29881987|ab|9|29881987|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Day-28 mortality was 33.7% overall, 27.2% in patients without major comorbidities, and 31.1% (COPD) to 56% (hematological malignancy) in patients with major comorbidities.
29881987|ab|10|29881987|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|By multivariable analysis, mortality was lower in patients with COPD and higher in those with chronic heart failure, solid tumors, or hematological malignancies.
29881987|ab|11|29881987|MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Mortality was independently associated with PaO2/FiO2 and PaCO2 on day 1, ARDS of pulmonary origin, worse SOFA score, and ICU-acquired events.

17208988|ab|1|17208988||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) signaling attenuates heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI), perhaps through reduction of fibrosis in the noninfarcted myocardium.
17208988|ab|2|17208988||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|However, its specific effect on the infarct tissue itself has not been fully clarified, which we examined in the present study.
17208988|ab|3|17208988||METHODS|METHODS|After MI induction in mice, treatment with the AT1 blocker olmesartan, beginning on the 3rd day post-MI, significantly improved survival (94%) 4 wk post-MI, compared with saline (53%) and hydralazine (73%).
17208988|ab|4|17208988||RESULTS|RESULTS|Olmesartan-treated mice also showed significant attenuation of left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, as well as significantly greater infarct wall thickness, although the absolute size of the infarct scar was unchanged.
17208988|ab|5|17208988||RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, significantly greater numbers of nonmyocytes (mainly vascular cells and myofibroblasts) were present within the infarct scar in olmesartan-treated hearts.
17208988|ab|6|17208988||RESULTS|RESULTS|Ten days post-MI, apoptosis among granulation tissue cells was significantly suppressed in the olmesartan-treated hearts, where expression of Fas, Bax, procaspase-3, and Daxx and activation of caspase-3, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and c-Jun were all significantly attenuated.
17208988|ab|7|17208988||RESULTS|RESULTS|By contrast, expression of Fas ligand, Bcl-2, and Fas-associated death domain and activation of caspase-8 were unaffected, suggesting olmesartan exerts a negative regulatory effect on the alternate pathway downstream of Fas receptor.
17208988|ab|8|17208988||RESULTS|RESULTS|In vitro, olmesartan dose-dependently inhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis in granulation tissue-derived myofibroblasts.
17208988|ab|9|17208988||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The present study proposes this antiapoptotic effect as another important mechanism for an AT1 blocker in improving post-MI ventricular remodeling, as well as its antifibrotic effect, and also suggests a significant link between renin-angiotensin and Fas/Fas ligand systems in postinfarction hearts.

24140265|ab|1|24140265||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The purpose of this study was to compare clinical and virological differences between non-cytopathic (ncp) bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)-1 and ncp BVDV-2 isolated from Korean field cases.
24140265|ab|2|24140265||OBJECTIVE|METHODS|Each five naive calves were experimentally infected with Korean ncp BVDV-1 or BVDV-2 isolates.
24140265|ab|3|24140265||METHODS|METHODS|Two additional age-matched animals were used as uninfected controls.
24140265|ab|4|24140265||RESULTS|RESULTS|Leukocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet counts declined in all infected calves, but were significantly lower and remained decreased longer in calves infected with ncp BVDV-2 isolate.
24140265|ab|5|24140265||RESULTS|RESULTS|The number of monocytes was greater in calves infected with ncp BVDV-2.
24140265|ab|6|24140265||RESULTS|RESULTS|Flow cytometric assay showed that lymphocyte apoptosis occurred with an increase of annexin-V positive cells in all infected calves by day 6.
24140265|ab|7|24140265||RESULTS|RESULTS|Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) concentration in all infected calves was lower than in control calves.
24140265|ab|8|24140265||RESULTS|RESULTS|In ncp BVDV-1 infected calves, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in the serum were increased by day 6 compared to calves infected with ncp BVDV-2.
24140265|ab|9|24140265||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These results demonstrated that the Korean ncp BVDV-2 isolate shows a reduced IFN-gamma production, indicating prevention of the antiviral activity, and therefore promotes the development of pathological effects.
29948050|ab|1|29948050|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an aggressive disease for which treatment strategies are continuously evolving.
29948050|ab|2|29948050|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We characterized trends in treatment modalities for MIBC from 2004 to 2013 (the "pre-immunotherapy era") and identified predictors of receiving the current standard of care treatment: neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC).
29948050|ab|3|29948050|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We used the National Cancer Database to identify individuals diagnosed with clinically localized MIBC from 2004 to 2013.
29948050|ab|4|29948050|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We calculated the yearly prevalence of NAC followed by RC, RC as first treatment, trimodal therapy, chemotherapy and/or radiation alone, and no treatment.
29948050|ab|5|29948050|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We then identified factors associated with receiving NAC prior to RC.
29948050|ab|6|29948050|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was a notable increase in the use of NAC followed by RC over the study period, from 3.68% in 2004 to 14.83% in 2013 (P < 0.001).
29948050|ab|7|29948050|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Factors associated with decreased odds of receiving this regimen included being older, Black, uninsured, less educated, and more burdened by comorbidities.
29948050|ab|8|29948050|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Rates of trimodal therapy and chemotherapy and/or radiation alone remained relatively constant (approximately 5 and 17%, respectively).
29948050|ab|9|29948050|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was a consistent decline in the proportion of patients who did not receive any treatment, down to 34.20% in 2013.
29948050|ab|10|29948050|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Trends in localized MIBC treatment have evolved substantially since the early 2000s, and certain patient characteristics are associated with lower odds of receiving the current standard of care.
29948050|ab|11|29948050|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This serves as a foundation from which to judge the impact of the upcoming immunotherapy era on the treatment landscape for this disease.

29953438|ab|5|29953438|METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS|RESULTS|RESULTS|PRNT results were obtained from 776 subjects with mean age of 9.6 years.
29953438|ab|6|29953438|METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS|RESULTS|RESULTS|765 (98.6%) neutralized one or more dengue serotype at a threshold of >10 (1/dil).
29953438|ab|7|29953438|METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Multitypic profiles were observed in 50.9% of the samples; a proportion which increased to 63.1% in subjects aged 15-18 years.
29953438|ab|8|29953438|METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Amongst monotypic samples, the highest proportion was reactive against DENV-2, followed by DENV-1, and DENV-3, with some variation across the country.
29953438|ab|9|29953438|METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS|RESULTS|RESULTS|DENV-4 was the least common serotype.
29953438|ab|10|29953438|METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The highest anti-dengue antibody titers were recorded against DENV-2, and increased with age to a geometric mean of 516.5 [1/dil] in the oldest age group.
29953438|ab|11|29953438|CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We found that all four dengue serotypes have been widely circulating in most of urban Indonesia, and more than half of children had already been exposed to >1 dengue serotype, demonstrating intense transmission often associated with more severe clinical episodes.

29957720|ab|1|29957720|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We examined whether the early initiation of sexual activity is associated with hypertension in US adults, and whether the timing of first menstruation is meaningful in regard of this association.
29957720|ab|2|29957720|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We also assessed the effect modification by ethnicity.
29957720|ab|3|29957720|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Using data from 2001 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we included 39 788 women.
29957720|ab|4|29957720|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The association of age at the first sexual intercourse (FSI) and hypertension (SBP >/= 130 mmHg or DBP >/= 80 mmHg) was examined using multivariate logistic regression.
29957720|ab|5|29957720|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Effect modification by ethnicity was assessed through a cross-product interaction term between age at FSI and ethnicity.
29957720|ab|6|29957720|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Among women with FSI after their first menstruation, the odds of hypertension decrease by 20% [95% confidence interval (CI) -27 to -13%] in those who experienced FSI after 19 years of age, relative to those with FSI before 19 years of age.
29957720|ab|7|29957720|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Ethnicity significantly modified the inverse association between age at FSI and hypertension (P value for interaction: 0.0003).
29957720|ab|8|29957720|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Among non-Hispanic white, having FSI aged at least 19 years reduced the odds of hypertension by 34% (95% CI -41 to -27%).
29957720|ab|9|29957720|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Turning to Latina women, the FSI before 19 years of age and before first menstruation resulted to a marked increase in the odds of hypertension [odds ratio = 1.38 (95% CI 1.15-1.65)].
29957720|ab|10|29957720|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In non-Hispanic black, the age at FSI was not linked to hypertension.
29957720|ab|11|29957720|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The FSI before 19 years of age is associated with hypertension during adulthood in US non-Hispanic white and Hispanic women, but not in non-Hispanic black.

29879881|ab|1|29879881|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Virtual Screening (VS) has emerged as an important tool in the drug development process, as it conducts efficient in silico searches over millions of compounds, ultimately increasing yields of potential drug leads.
29879881|ab|2|29879881|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|As a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful way of conducting VS for drug leads.
29879881|ab|3|29879881|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|ML for VS generally involves assembling a filtered training set of compounds, comprised of known actives and inactives.
29879881|ab|4|29879881|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|After training the model, it is validated and, if sufficiently accurate, used on previously unseen databases to screen for novel compounds with desired drug target binding activity.
29879881|ab|5|29879881|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The study aims to review ML-based methods used for VS and applications to Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug discovery.
29879881|ab|6|29879881|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|To update the current knowledge on ML for VS, we review thorough backgrounds, explanations, and VS applications of the following ML techniques: Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
29879881|ab|7|29879881|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|All techniques have found success in VS, but the future of VS is likely to lean more heavily toward the use of neural networks - and more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are a subset of ANN that utilize convolution.
29879881|ab|8|29879881|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We additionally conceptualize a work flow for conducting ML-based VS for potential therapeutics of for AD, a complex neurodegenerative disease with no known cure and prevention.
29879881|ab|9|29879881|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|This both serves as an example of how to apply the concepts introduced earlier in the review and as a potential workflow for future implementation.

18333980|ab|1|18333980||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|A pivotal period in the development of language occurs in the second year of life, when language comprehension undergoes rapid acceleration.
18333980|ab|2|18333980||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, the brain bases of these advances remain speculative as there is currently no functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from healthy, typically developing toddlers at this age.
18333980|ab|3|18333980||METHODS|METHODS|We investigated the neural basis of speech comprehension in this critical age period by measuring fMRI activity during passive speech comprehension in 10 toddlers (mean +/- SD; 21 +/- 4 mo) and 10 3-year-old children (39 +/- 3 mo) during natural sleep.
18333980|ab|4|18333980||METHODS|METHODS|During sleep, the children were presented passages of forward and backward speech in 20-second blocks separated by 20-second periods of no sound presentation.
18333980|ab|5|18333980||RESULTS|RESULTS|Toddlers produced significantly greater activation in frontal, occipital, and cerebellar regions than 3-year-old children in response to forward speech.
18333980|ab|6|18333980||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our results suggest that rapid language acquisition during the second year of life may require the utilization of frontal, cerebellar, and occipital regions in addition to classical superior temporal language areas.
18333980|ab|7|18333980||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These findings are consistent with the interactive specialization hypothesis, which proposes that cognitive abilities develop from the interaction of brain regions that include and extend beyond those used in the adult brain.
18043997|ab|1|18043997||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Anthracyclines are antineoplastic agents that are effective against solid tumors and hematological malignancies.
18043997|ab|2|18043997||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, drug-induced cardiotoxicity imposes dose limitations.
18043997|ab|3|18043997||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Myocardial damage due to anthracyclines has been assessed by measuring left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or fraction shortening (FS) by echocardiography and criteria for discontinuing treatment have been established based on these indexes.
18043997|ab|4|18043997||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, cardiotoxicity is already irreversible when either LVEF or FS fulfills these criteria.
18043997|ab|5|18043997||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The Tei-index has recently been established to assess combined systolic and diastolic myocardial function during echocardiography.
18043997|ab|6|18043997||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|It can also detect small changes in cardiac function.
18043997|ab|7|18043997||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|We therefore surmised that the Tei-index would reflect early myocardial damage induced by anthracyclines.
18043997|ab|8|18043997||METHODS|METHODS|We treated 23 patients with the anthracycline, doxorubicin (DXR), and examined them at least twice during the treatment.
18043997|ab|9|18043997||RESULTS|RESULTS|An additional dose of DXR significantly correlated with a change in the Tei-index (DeltaTei-index).
18043997|ab|10|18043997||RESULTS|RESULTS|In contrast, a change in LVEF did not correlate with increased doses of DXR.
18043997|ab|11|18043997||RESULTS|RESULTS|The DeltaTei-index did not correlate with either LVEF or the Tei-index before treatment.
18043997|ab|12|18043997||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These results suggested that the DeltaTei-index is a more sensitive indicator of early cardiotoxicity induced by anthracyclines than LVEF regardless of its value before treatment.

26922047|ab|1|26922047||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Microarrays of biomolecules hold great promise in the fields of genomics, proteomics, and clinical assays on account of their remarkably parallel and high-throughput assay capability.
26922047|ab|2|26922047||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, the fluorescence detection used in most conventional DNA microarrays is still limited by sensitivity.
26922047|ab|3|26922047||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|In this study, we have demonstrated a novel universal and highly sensitive platform for fluorescent detection of sequence specific DNA at the femtomolar level by combining dextran-coated microarrays with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) signal amplification.
26922047|ab|4|26922047||METHODS|METHODS|Three-dimensional dextran matrix was covalently coated on glass surface as the scaffold to immobilize DNA recognition probes to increase the surface binding capacity and accessibility.
26922047|ab|5|26922047||METHODS|METHODS|DNA nanowire tentacles were formed on the matrix surface for efficient signal amplification by capturing multiple fluorescent molecules in a highly ordered way.
26922047|ab|6|26922047||RESULTS|RESULTS|By quantifying microscopic fluorescent signals, the synergetic effects of dextran and HCR greatly improved sensitivity of DNA microarrays, with a detection limit of 10fM (1x10(5) molecules).
26922047|ab|7|26922047||RESULTS|RESULTS|This detection assay could recognize one-base mismatch with fluorescence signals dropped down to ~20%.

24480187|ab|1|24480187||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Peptide-based epitope tagging technology is universally used in nearly all kind of research projects that involve biochemical characterization of a target protein, but not many systems are fully compatible with purification purpose.
24480187|ab|2|24480187||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|By utilizing an anti-human podoplanin antibody NZ-1, we constructed a novel epitope tag system.
24480187|ab|3|24480187||METHODS|BACKGROUND|NZ-1 possesses exceptionally high affinity toward a dodecapeptide dubbed "PA tag", with a characteristic slow dissociation kinetics.
24480187|ab|4|24480187||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Because of its high affinity, PA-tagged proteins in a dilute sample can be captured by immobilized NZ-1 resin in a near complete fashion and eluted by a solution of free PA peptide.
24480187|ab|5|24480187||RESULTS|RESULTS|This enabled efficient one-step purification of various proteins including soluble (an ectodomain fragment of neuropilin-1) and membrane (epidermal growth factor receptor) proteins expressed in mammalian cells.
24480187|ab|6|24480187||RESULTS|RESULTS|Mild regeneration condition of the peptide-bound antibody ensures repeated use of the antibody resin, indicating a cost-efficient nature of the system.
24480187|ab|7|24480187||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Together with its outstanding performance in the immunodetection experiments (i.e., Western blotting and flow cytometry), PA tag/NZ-1 system will offer a great chance to facilitate protein production in many biomedical research projects.

21369862|ab|1|21369862||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Transient chromatic pattern visual evoked potentials (VEPs) have been found to be less repeatable in morphology in children than in adults at low to moderate chromatic contrasts.
21369862|ab|2|21369862||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The purpose of this study is to investigate whether low repeatability of VEP components can be associated with high alpha power, in a comparison of alpha activity in children and adults.
21369862|ab|3|21369862||METHODS|METHODS|Transient chromatic contrast and achromatic resolution VEPs were recorded in children (n = 14, mean 9.6 years) and adults (n = 12, mean 21.8 years) with normal vision and assessed for repeatability.
21369862|ab|4|21369862||METHODS|METHODS|Isoluminant chromatic (magenta-cyan) and luminance-modulated achromatic grating stimuli were presented at and above psychophysical threshold levels, in pattern onset-offset at 2 Hz temporal frequency.
21369862|ab|5|21369862||METHODS|METHODS|EEGs (eyes closed and open) were recorded as single sweeps (1 s long) over three 30 s periods while facing a uniform computer display.
21369862|ab|6|21369862||METHODS|METHODS|An index of VEP detectability by observation was developed based on VEP component repeatability.
21369862|ab|7|21369862||METHODS|METHODS|The index was examined for correlations with alpha-wave parameters.
21369862|ab|8|21369862||METHODS|METHODS|Alpha power was calculated as the sum of the powers of 8-13 Hz frequencies of the EEG sweeps (using the discrete Fourier transform).
21369862|ab|9|21369862||METHODS|METHODS|Alpha power variability was calculated using the standard deviation of the powers of each sweep in a 30 s time period.
21369862|ab|10|21369862||RESULTS|RESULTS|The children had significantly higher alpha powers than the adults for both the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions.
21369862|ab|11|21369862||RESULTS|RESULTS|Alpha power variability was significantly higher for the eyes-open condition only.
21369862|ab|12|21369862||RESULTS|RESULTS|There was no relationship between alpha power parameters and index of VEP detectability by observation for both the chromatic and achromatic grating stimuli.
21369862|ab|13|21369862||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Poor repeatability of transient pattern VEPs is not associated with high alpha power or its variability in EEG measurements in older children or young adults at Oz.

29954744|ab|1|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of young patients with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) versus obstructive disease (myocardial infarction due to coronary artery disease [MI-CAD]) and among patients with MINOCA by sex and subtype.
29954744|ab|2|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|METHODS|Between 2008 and 2012, VIRGO (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients) prospectively enrolled acute myocardial infarction patients aged 18 to 55 years in 103 hospitals at a 2:1 ratio of women to men.
29954744|ab|3|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|METHODS|Using an angiographically driven taxonomy, we defined patients as having MI-CAD if there was revascularization or plaque >/=50% and as having MINOCA if there was <50% obstruction or a nonplaque mechanism.
29954744|ab|4|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|METHODS|Patients who did not have an angiogram or who received thrombolytics before an angiogram were excluded.
29954744|ab|5|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|METHODS|Outcomes included 1- and 12-month mortality and functional (Seattle Angina Questionnaire [SAQ]) and psychosocial status.
29954744|ab|6|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Of 2690 patients undergoing angiography, 2374 (88.4%) had MI-CAD, 299 (11.1%) had MINOCA, and 17 (0.6%) remained unclassified.
29954744|ab|7|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Women had 5 times higher odds of having MINOCA than men (14.9% versus 3.5%; odds ratio: 4.84; 95% confidence interval, 3.29-7.13).
29954744|ab|8|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|RESULTS|MINOCA patients were more likely to be without traditional cardiac risk factors (8.7% versus 1.3%; P<0.001) but more predisposed to hypercoaguable states than MI-CAD patients (3.0% versus 1.3%; P=0.036).
29954744|ab|9|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Women with MI-CAD were more likely than those with MINOCA to be menopausal (55.2% versus 41.2%; P<0.001) or to have a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (16.8% versus 11.0%; P=0.028).
29954744|ab|10|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|RESULTS|The MINOCA mechanisms varied: a nonplaque mechanism was identified for 75 patients (25.1%), and their clinical profiles and management also varied.
29954744|ab|11|29954744|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|RESULTS|One- and 12-month mortality with MINOCA and MI-CAD was similar (1-month: 1.1% and 1.7% [P=0.43]; 12-month: 0.6% and 2.3% [P=0.68], respectively), as was adjusted 12-month SAQ quality of life (76.5 versus 73.5, respectively; P=0.06).

29921529|ab|1|29921529|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique with potential for cost-effective therapeutic neuromodulation.
29921529|ab|2|29921529|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although positive therapeutic effects were found by stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), few studies have investigated physiological effects of DLPFC-tDCS.
29921529|ab|3|29921529|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To investigate effects of tDCS with different parameter settings applied to the left DLPFC on cortical responses, measured by resting-state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked/induced EEG responses.
29921529|ab|4|29921529|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|22 healthy subjects underwent 5 tDCS sessions with different tDCS parameter settings in a double-blinded randomized crossover design (1: 1.5mA, anode left-DLPFC, cathode right-DLPFC; 2: 1.5mA, cathode left-DLPFC, anode right-DLPFC; 3: 0.5mA, anode left-DLPFC, cathode right-DLPFC; 4: 1.5mA, anode left-DLPFC, cathode left deltoid muscle; 5: sham stimulation).
29921529|ab|5|29921529|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Rs-EEG and TMS-EEG were recorded before and after tDCS.
29921529|ab|6|29921529|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Rs-EEG power spectrum analysis showed no difference comparing baseline with post stimulation in any of the tDCS conditions.
29921529|ab|7|29921529|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|TMS-EEG evoked potential amplitude decreased in parietal cortex after 1.5mA left-DLPFC anodal tDCS, and TMS-induced gamma and theta oscillations decreased after all conditions using left-DLPFC anodal tDCS.
29921529|ab|8|29921529|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Left-DLPFC cathodal tDCS did not lead to significant change.
29921529|ab|9|29921529|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|None of the post-intervention changes was different when comparing the effects across conditions, including sham.
29921529|ab|10|29921529|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our study does not provide evidence that a single tDCS session results in significant changes in rs-EEG, using the current stimulation parameters.
29921529|ab|11|29921529|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Significant changes in EEG responses to TMS pulses were observed following the anodal 1.5mA tDCS interventions, although these changes were not statistically significant in a group comparison.

16595799|ab|3|16595799||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Dna2 is well-suited to process long flaps, which are converted to nicks by the subsequent action of Fen1.
16595799|ab|4|16595799||METHODS|METHODS|In this report, we purified human Dna2 as a recombinant protein from human cells transfected with the cDNA of the human homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dna2.
16595799|ab|5|16595799||RESULTS|RESULTS|We demonstrated that the purified human Dna2 enzyme contains intrinsic endonuclease and DNA-dependent ATPase activities, but is devoid of detectable DNA helicase activity.
16595799|ab|6|16595799||RESULTS|RESULTS|We determined a number of enzymatic properties of human Dna2 including its substrate specificity.
16595799|ab|7|16595799||RESULTS|RESULTS|When both 5' and 3' tailed ssDNAs were present in a substrate, such as a forked-structured one, both single-stranded regions were cleaved by human Dna2 (hDna2) with equal efficiency.
16595799|ab|8|16595799||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Based on this and other properties of hDna2, it is likely that this enzyme facilitates the removal of 5' and 3' regions in equilibrating flaps that are likely to arise during the processing of Okazaki fragments in human cells.
29953953|ab|1|29953953|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Since the 1950's, hydrocephalus can be treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunts, usually to the peritoneal cavity or to the right cardiac atrium.
29953953|ab|2|29953953|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, due to their siphoning effect, these shunts lead to non-physiological cerebrospinal fluid drainage, with possible co-morbidity and high revision rates.
29953953|ab|3|29953953|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|More sophisticated shunt valve systems significantly increase costs and technical complexity and remain unsuccessful in a subgroup of patients.
29953953|ab|4|29953953|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In an attempt to obtain physiological cerebrospinal fluid shunting, many neurosurgical pioneers shunted towards the dural sinuses, taking advantage of the physiological anti-siphoning effect of the internal jugular veins.
29953953|ab|5|29953953|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Despite several promising reports, the ventriculosinus shunts did not yet become standard neurosurgical practice.
29953953|ab|6|29953953|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In this mono-centric prospective clinical study, we implanted the retrograde ventriculosinus shunt, as advocated by El-Shafei, in 10 patients.
29953953|ab|7|29953953|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This article reports on our operation technique and long-term outcome, including 4 patients in whom this shunt was implanted as a rescue.
29953953|ab|8|29953953|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Implantation of a ventriculosinus shunt proved to be a feasible technique, warranting physiological drainage of cerebrospinal fluid.
29953953|ab|9|29953953|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, only in 3 out of 14 patients, functionality of the retrograde ventriculosinus shunt was maintained during more than 6 years follow-up.
29953953|ab|10|29953953|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In our opinion, these shunts fail because present venous access devices are difficult to implant correctly and get too easily obstructed.
29953953|ab|11|29953953|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|After discussing possible causes of this frequent obstruction, a new dural venous sinus access device is presented.
29953953|ab|12|29953953|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|An easy to implant and thrombogenic-resistant dural venous sinus access device needs to be developed before ventriculosinus shunting can become general practice.
29883939|ab|1|29883939|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Humans alter gait in response to unusual gait circumstances to accomplish the task of walking.
29883939|ab|2|29883939|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|For instance, subjects spontaneously increase leg compliance at a step length threshold as step length increases.
29883939|ab|3|29883939|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|Here we test the hypothesis that this transition occurs based on the level of energy expenditure, where compliant walking becomes less energetically demanding at long step lengths.
29883939|ab|4|29883939|RESEARCH QUESTION|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To map and compare the metabolic cost of normal and compliant walking as step length increases.
29883939|ab|5|29883939|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|10 healthy individuals walked on a treadmill using progressively increasing step lengths (100%, 120%, 140% and 160% of preferred step length), in both normal and compliant leg walking as energy expenditure was recorded via indirect calorimetry.
29883939|ab|6|29883939|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Leg compliance was controlled by lowering the center-of-mass trajectory during stance, forcing the leg to flex and extend as the body moved over the foot contact.
29883939|ab|7|29883939|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|For normal step lengths, compliant leg walking was more costly than normal walking gait, but compliant leg walking energetic cost did not increase as rapidly for longer step lengths.
29883939|ab|8|29883939|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|This led to an intersection between normal and compliant walking cost curves at 114% relative step length (regression analysis; r(2)=0.92 for normal walking; r(2)=0.65 for compliant walking).
29883939|ab|9|29883939|SIGNIFICANCE|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Compliant leg walking is less energetically demanding at longer step lengths where a spontaneous shift to compliant walking has been observed, suggesting the human motor control system is sensitive to energetic requirements and will employ alternate movement patterns if advantageous strategies are available.
29883939|ab|10|29883939|SIGNIFICANCE|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The transition could be attributed to the interplay between (i) leg work controlling body travel during single stance and (ii) leg work to control energy loss in the step-to-step transition.
29883939|ab|11|29883939|SIGNIFICANCE|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Compliant leg walking requires more stance leg work at normal step lengths, but involves less energy loss at the step-to-step transition for very long steps.
18843571|ab|1|18843571||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is obtained by the injection of one of a series of compounds that cross the blood-brain barrier and are distributed in the brain according to regional perfusion or to the density of a given receptor.
18843571|ab|2|18843571||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The regional brain distribution of the injected compound can be measured because it is bound to a radioactive substance that emits photons.
18843571|ab|3|18843571||METHODS|BACKGROUND|Emitted photons are collimated to facilitate determining their source and detected with sodium iodine crystal detectors.
18843571|ab|4|18843571||METHODS|BACKGROUND|Finally, the techniques of CT are used to reconstruct the density of photons emitted by each volume element (voxel) of the brain.
18843571|ab|5|18843571||RESULTS|BACKGROUND|Less expensive and more widely distributed in nuclear medicine departments than positron emission tomography, SPECT is currently used mainly in the evaluation for epilepsy surgery, of cerebrovascular disease, and of the parkinsonian and other neurodegenerative syndromes.
18843571|ab|6|18843571||CONCLUSIONS|OBJECTIVE|In this article, we discuss the technological aspects of brain SPECT and its clinical neurological applications.
29956392|ab|1|29956392|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The Therapeutic Practices for Distress Management (TPDM) project was carried out to support clinicians in integrating recommendations from four clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in routine care at five Pan Canadian cancer care sites.
29956392|ab|2|29956392|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Using a concurrent, mixed-method study design and knowledge translation (KT) activities, this project included two phases: phase I-a baseline/preparation phase and phase II-an intervention phase plus evaluation.
29956392|ab|3|29956392|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The intervention phase (the focus of this report) included a one-year education and supervision program (24 hours in virtual class; 12-hour group supervision).
29956392|ab|4|29956392|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Primary outcomes were knowledge and self-efficacy in practicing CPGs as measured by a Knowledge and Self-Efficacy Survey (KSES).
29956392|ab|5|29956392|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A secondary outcome was observer-rated performances with standardized patients (objective structured clinical exams).

29956392|ab|7|29956392|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The TPDM program was effective in accomplishing change in knowledge, self-efficacy, and performance.
29956392|ab|8|29956392|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|All measures demonstrated significant change pre and post module, with evidence of increasing knowledge (P < .01) and confidence (P < .01) over time.
29956392|ab|9|29956392|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Further, there was evidence of a shift in barriers and enablers to practicing in alignment with the CPGs.

17498590|ab|1|17498590||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To test the hypothesis of whether cellular blue nevi (CBN) may originate from "ordinary" compound and dermal nevi, a total of 275 melanocytic nevi including 59 CBN, 34 ordinary blue nevi, 87 combined nevi (including 43 so-called clonal nevi), 35 deep penetrating nevi, and 60 ordinary compound and dermal nevi (30 of each) were studied for the presence of so-called ball-in-mitts and microalveolar structures.
17498590|ab|2|17498590||METHODS|METHODS|A ball-in-mitts structure was defined as a single centrally placed melanocyte with a round to oval nucleus (the "ball" cell) and a clear, dusty, or pigmented cytoplasm encircled by a single dendritic cell (the "mitt" cell) with an oval to spindle-shaped nucleus and slender bipolar processes containing melanin and surrounding at least one fourth of the ball's diameter.
17498590|ab|3|17498590||METHODS|METHODS|A microalveolar structure was defined as a group of 2 to 10 centrally placed melanocytes with round to oval nuclei and clear, dusty, or pigmented cytoplasm (balls) surrounded by one or more cells (mitts) with spindle-shaped nuclei and slender bipolar processes containing melanin.
17498590|ab|4|17498590||RESULTS|RESULTS|Microscopically, ball-in-mitt and microalveolar structures were detected in all types of nevi studied, with the highest incidence in combined nevi (82%), CBN (76%), and ordinary "nonblue" nevi (73%).
17498590|ab|5|17498590||RESULTS|RESULTS|In CBN, ball-in-mitts and microalveolar structures tended to be located in the deeper portion of the lesions, whereas in ordinary nonblue nevi, they were most often found superficially, just below the epidermis; in clonal nevi, these structures were often confined to the "clonal" parts.
17498590|ab|6|17498590||RESULTS|RESULTS|Immunohistochemically, ball-in-mitts and microalveolar structures were positive for HMB45.
17498590|ab|7|17498590||RESULTS|RESULTS|Ultrastructurally, the balls tended to have round to oval nuclei, whereas the mitts possessed oval, elongated to spindled nuclei.
17498590|ab|8|17498590||RESULTS|RESULTS|Melanosomes were found in various stages in the cells of both structures.
17498590|ab|9|17498590||RESULTS|RESULTS|The cytoplasm of the mitts typically formed elongated polar processes, sometimes with club-like widenings at the ends, completely or partially encircling the balls.
17498590|ab|10|17498590||RESULTS|RESULTS|In the microalveolar structures, the adjacent cells forming the mitts surrounded the ball cells like a chain.
17498590|ab|11|17498590||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our study suggests that some or even most cases of CBN may evolve from ordinary nonblue nevi.
17498590|ab|12|17498590||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This process may involve several steps and is probably reflected by the appearances of combined nevi, deep penetrating nevi, and CBN.
17498590|ab|13|17498590||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These nevi often show a morphological overlap, and ball-in-mitts and microalveolar structures found in various stages of their development seem to greatly account for this overlap.
23258531|ab|1|23258531||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|miRNAs are a class of endogenous non-coding RNA, which can regulate downstream target genes through binding to the 3'UTR of those genes.
23258531|ab|2|23258531||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Numerous studies have indicated that abnormal expression of miRNAs is implicated in tumor development.
23258531|ab|3|23258531||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Aberrant expression of miR-31 has been found in various cancers, including colorectal cancer.
23258531|ab|4|23258531||RESULTS|RESULTS|Here, we show that miR-31 is upregulated in human colon cancer tissues and cell lines, and that repression of miR-31 inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agarose.
23258531|ab|5|23258531||OBJECTIVE|METHODS|To further elucidate the mechanism underlying the role of miR-31 in promoting colon cancer, we used online miRNA target prediction databases and found that the tumor suppressor RhoTBT1 may be a target of miR-31.
23258531|ab|6|23258531||RESULTS|RESULTS|Imunohistochemistry assay revealed that RhoBTB1 was significantly decreased in HT29 cells.
23258531|ab|7|23258531||RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, ectopic expression of miR-31 reduced RhoBTB1 in the colon cancer cell line HT29.
23258531|ab|8|23258531||RESULTS|RESULTS|The results suggested that suppression of RhoBTB1 may be responsible for colon tumorigenesis, which was inhibited directly by miR-31.
23258531|ab|9|23258531||RESULTS|RESULTS|The results of MTT and soft agarose colony-formation assays showed that knockdown of RhoBTB1 by RNAi induced cell proliferation, and colony formation in soft agarose, which mimicked the function of miR-31.
23258531|ab|10|23258531||RESULTS|RESULTS|This further suggested that suppression of RhoBTB1 was responsible for colon tumorigenesis.
23258531|ab|11|23258531||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In conclusion, we found that miR-31 acts as an oncogene in colon cancer and identified RhoBTB1 as a new target of miR-31 further study demonstrated that miR-31 contributed to the development of colon cancer at least partly by targeting RhoBTB1.
29940592|ab|1|29940592|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The SERVE-HF study has raised questions concerning the higher mortality under adaptive servoventilation.
29940592|ab|2|29940592|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The ventilatory mode was discussed as a possible aggravating factor.
29940592|ab|3|29940592|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We wondered if the data recorded by the adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV)-devices in heart failure patients with CSA-CSR +/- OSA are different in terms of respiratory parameters and therapeutic pressures compared to patients with CPAP-resistant/emergent-CSA with normal BNP/NT-pro-BNP.
29940592|ab|4|29940592|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patients were included, if ASV had normalized respiratory disturbance index in the first night of application and after at least 6 weeks.
29940592|ab|5|29940592|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|ASV-device data were analyzed in terms of respiratory rate (RR), min ventilation (MV), endexpiratory (EEP), peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak) and median pressure.
29940592|ab|6|29940592|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared to CPAP-resistant/emergent-CSA with normal BNP/NT-pro-BNP (n = 25), CSA-CSR- (n = 13) CSA-CSR+OSA-patients (n = 32) with elevated BNP/NT-pro-BNP had higher RR (p < 0.01) in the first night of ASV therapy and during follow-up (15.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 17.3 +/- 2.4/min) with similar MV (6.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 6.6 +/- 1.3 L), resulting in significantly lower tidal volumes.
29940592|ab|7|29940592|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|EEP (5.6 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.5 +/- 1.1 hPa), Pmedian and Ppeak (9.8 +/- 1.5 vs. 9.7 +/- 1.2 hPa) were comparable.
29940592|ab|8|29940592|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Ventilatory parameters were not different between LVEF < 40, 40-49, and >/=50%, neither within the whole group nor the group of CSA-CSR +/- OSA and heart failure.
29940592|ab|9|29940592|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Patients with heart failure and CSA-CSR +/- OSA have higher RRs but similar MV under ASV-therapy than patients with CSA and normal BNP.
29940592|ab|10|29940592|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This indicates higher dead space ventilation.
29940592|ab|11|29940592|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|EF was not found to have an influence on the ventilatory parameters.

29902679|ab|3|29902679|STUDY DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|We conducted a case-cohort study on GE patients linked to the outbreak who presented to the emergency department of a tertiary-care hospital near the outbreak area, from 18 May to 11 June 2016.
29902679|ab|4|29902679|STUDY DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|Stools were tested for gastrointestinal pathogens including rotavirus antigen and positive rotavirus samples were subject to genotyping.
29902679|ab|5|29902679|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A total of 57 adult GE patients, with a median age of 40 (range 18 to 84) years, were included.

29905844|ab|2|29905844|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Interstitial magnetic resonance (MR) guided focused ultrasound (iMRgFUS) may be an alternate ablation technique which limits thermal tissue charring as compared to laser therapy (LITT) and can produce larger ablation patterns nearer the surface than transcranial MR guided focused ultrasound (tcMRgFUS).
29905844|ab|3|29905844|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To describe our experience with interstitial focused ultrasound (iFUS) ablations in swine, using MR-guided robotically assisted (MRgRA) delivery.
29905844|ab|4|29905844|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In an initial 3 animals, we optimized the workflow of the robot in the MR suite and made modifications to the robotic arm to allow range of motion.
29905844|ab|5|29905844|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Then, 6 farm pigs (4 acute, 2 survival) underwent 7 iMRgFUS ablations using MRgRA.
29905844|ab|6|29905844|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We altered dosing to explore differences between thermal dosing in brain as compared to other tissues.

26581570|ab|1|26581570||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Synpolydactyly (SPD) is a rare congenital limb disorder characterized by syndactyly between the third and fourth fingers and an additional digit in the syndactylous web.
26581570|ab|2|26581570||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In most cases SPD is caused by heterozygous mutations in HOXD13 resulting in the expansion of a N-terminal polyalanine tract.
26581570|ab|3|26581570||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|If homozygous, the mutation results in severe shortening of all metacarpals and phalanges with a morphological transformation of metacarpals to carpals.
26581570|ab|4|26581570||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Here, we describe a novel homozygous missense mutation in a family with unaffected consanguineous parents and severe brachydactyly and metacarpal-to-carpal transformation in the affected child.
26581570|ab|5|26581570||METHODS|METHODS|We performed whole exome sequencing on the index patient, followed by Sanger sequencing of parents and patient to investigate cosegregation.
26581570|ab|6|26581570||METHODS|METHODS|The DNA-binding ability of the mutant protein was tested with electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
26581570|ab|7|26581570||RESULTS|RESULTS|We demonstrate that the c.938C>G (p.313T>R) mutation in the DNA-binding domain of HOXD13 prevents binding to DNA in vitro.
26581570|ab|8|26581570||RESULTS|RESULTS|Our results show to our knowledge for the first time that a missense mutation in HOXD13 underlies severe brachydactyly with metacarpal-to-carpal transformation.
26581570|ab|9|26581570||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The mutation is non-penetrant in heterozygous carriers.
26581570|ab|10|26581570||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In conjunction with the literature we propose the possibility that the metacarpal-to-carpal transformation results from a homozygous loss of functional HOXD13 protein in humans in combination with an accumulation of non-functional HOXD13 that might be able to interact with other transcription factors in the developing limb.

29952710|ab|10|29952710|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A total of 2,945 moderate to severe psoriasis and/or PsA patients were identified.
29952710|ab|11|29952710|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Of those, 1,899 (64.5%) were persistent and 1,046 (35.5%) were nonpersistent.
29952710|ab|12|29952710|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared with nonpersistent patients, persistent patients were older (49.2 vs. 45.5 years; P < 0.001) and more likely to be male (52% vs. 45%; P < 0.001).
29952710|ab|13|29952710|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|More persistent patients were diagnosed with dyslipidemia (40% vs. 35%; P = 0.002), had lower antidepressant use (23.4% vs. 27.4%; P < 0.001), and had lower anxiolytic use (30% vs. 37%; P < 0.001) compared with nonpersistent patients.
29952710|ab|14|29952710|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, nonpersistent patients had higher total medical costs ($12,457 vs. $8,964; P < 0.001) compared with persistent patients, and ambulatory visits (23.9 vs. 21.4; P = 0.007) were a major contributor.
29952710|ab|15|29952710|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Approximately 40% of the total overall medical costs were attributed to psoriasis and PsA.
29952710|ab|16|29952710|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Although persistent patients incurred higher pharmacy costs ($10,684 vs. $7,849; P < 0.001) due to higher biologic use and the potentially high per-unit cost of biologics, their psoriasis- and/or PsA-related medical costs were significantly lower than those of nonpersistent patients ($3,395 vs. $5,041; P < 0.001).
29952710|ab|17|29952710|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Total overall costs combining medical and pharmacy costs were similar between the cohorts ($22,678 vs. $21,477; P = 0.122).
29952710|ab|18|29952710|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Moderate to severe psoriasis and/or PsA patients who were persistent on index biologic treatment had higher pharmacy utilization and costs, albeit with lower medical costs and similar total costs, compared with nonpersistent patients.

29948583|ab|1|29948583|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In spite of several proposed predictors for premature ventricular complex (PVC)-induced cardiomyopathy (PVC-CMP), the specific ECG features of idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) PVC-CMP remain unknown.
29948583|ab|2|29948583|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 130 patients (49 males, mean age 44 years) with symptomatic and drug-refractory idiopathic RVOT PVCs undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) were enrolled.
29948583|ab|3|29948583|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The patients were categorized into two groups, including those with and without RVOT PVC-CMP (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%, n = 25 and LVEF >/= 50%, n = 105, respectively).
29948583|ab|4|29948583|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The 12-lead PVC morphologies were assessed.
29948583|ab|5|29948583|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Patients with RVOT PVC-CMP had a lower LVEF (42 +/- 5% vs. 60 +/- 7%, P < 0.01) and higher PVC burden (24 +/- 14% vs. 15 +/- 11%, P = 0.02) when compared to patients without RVOT PVC-CMP.
29948583|ab|6|29948583|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The PVC features in those with PVC-CMP displayed a significantly wider QRS duration (143 +/- 14 ms vs. 132 +/- 17 ms, P < 0.01) and higher peak deflection index (PDI; 0.60 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.08, P < 0.01).
29948583|ab|7|29948583|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the QRS duration (odds ratio (OR) 1.130, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.020-1.253, P = 0.02) and PDI (OR 1.240, 95% CI 1.004-1.532, P = 0.04) were independently associated with RVOT PVC-CMP.
29948583|ab|8|29948583|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Based on the receiver-operating characteristic analysis, a QRS duration > 139 ms and PDI > 0.57 could predict RVOT PVC-CMP (area under the curve (AUC) 0.710 and AUC 0.690, respectively).

29948583|ab|10|29948583|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The ECG parameters, including a wider QRS duration and higher PDI, could predict the development of RVOT PVC-CMP, which could be effectively treated by RFCA.
20100241|ab|1|20100241||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In this study, we test whether established non-native species induce functional changes in natural assemblages.
20100241|ab|2|20100241||METHODS|METHODS|We combined data on the body size of freshwater fish species and a worldwide data set of native and non-native fish species for 1058 river basins.
20100241|ab|3|20100241||METHODS|RESULTS|We show that non-native fish species are significantly larger than their native counterparts and are a non-random subset of the worldwide set of fish species.
20100241|ab|4|20100241||RESULTS|RESULTS|We further show that the median body size of fish assemblages increases in the course of introductions.
20100241|ab|5|20100241||RESULTS|RESULTS|These changes are the opposite of those expected under several null models.
20100241|ab|6|20100241||RESULTS|RESULTS|Introductions shift body size patterns related to several abiotic factors (e.g. glacier coverage and temperature) in a way that modifies latitudinal patterns (i.e. Bergmann's rule), especially in the southern hemisphere.
20100241|ab|7|20100241||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Together, these results show that over just the last two centuries human beings have induced changes in the global biogeography of freshwater fish body size, which could affect ecosystem properties.
29951711|ab|1|29951711|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To investigate the association between iron supplementation during early pregnancy and the presence of de novo hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation (either gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia).
29951711|ab|2|29951711|STUDY DESIGN|METHODS|METHODS|Retrospective cohort study.
29951711|ab|3|29951711|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of non-anemic pregnant women who received first antenatal care at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University, Bangkok, Thailand, during the June 2009-December 2010 study period.
29951711|ab|4|29951711|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|All included women had blood pressure and urine albumin level data that were recorded at each antenatal visit.
29951711|ab|5|29951711|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The study population was divided into one of the two following groups: iron supplementation starting at gestational age (GA) < 16 weeks (study group) or GA >/= 16 weeks (control group).
29951711|ab|6|29951711|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A comparison of the proportion of de novo hypertension arising after 20 weeks' gestation was then performed between groups.
29951711|ab|7|29951711|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Four hundred non-anemic pregnant women were included, with 200 patients allocated to each groups.
29951711|ab|8|29951711|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The overall incidence of de novo hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation was 10% (40/400), with significantly higher prevalence in the study group than that in the control group [13.5% (27/200) vs.
29951711|ab|9|29951711|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|6.5% (13/200); relative risk: 2.14, 95%, CI 1.22-3.73; p = 0.008].
29951711|ab|10|29951711|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|None of the women in this study developed anemia at time of delivery.
29951711|ab|11|29951711|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was no significant difference between groups for GA at delivery, birth weight, or birth asphyxia.
29951711|ab|12|29951711|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In our study population, iron supplementation before 16 weeks' GA was significantly associated with increased risk of developing de novo hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation.
25055785|ab|1|25055785||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Mutagenesis Assistant Program (MAP) is a web-based statistical tool to develop directed evolution strategies by investigating the consequences at the amino acid level of the mutational biases of random mutagenesis methods on any given gene.
25055785|ab|2|25055785||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|The latest development of the program, the MAP(2.0)3D server, correlates the generated amino acid substitution patterns of a specific random mutagenesis method to the sequence and structural information of the target protein.
25055785|ab|3|25055785||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|The combined information can be used to select an experimental strategy that improves the chances of obtaining functionally efficient and/or stable enzyme variants.
25055785|ab|4|25055785||RESULTS|RESULTS|Hence, the MAP(2.0)3D server facilitates the "in silico" prescreening of the target gene by predicting the amino acid diversity generated in a random mutagenesis library.
25055785|ab|5|25055785||RESULTS|OBJECTIVE|Here, we describe the features of MAP(2.0)3D server by analyzing, as an example, the cytochrome P450BM3 monooxygenase (CYP102A1).

18194266|ab|1|18194266||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|As effector cells in host defence, neutrophils actively destroy invading microorganisms via a potent antimicrobial arsenal composed of oxidants and antimicrobial peptides.
18194266|ab|2|18194266||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Psoriasin, an Escherichia coli-cidal antimicrobial protein, has been found to be overexpressed in psoriasis, a skin disease characterized by infiltration of neutrophils.
18194266|ab|3|18194266||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|In addition to its microbicidal activities and chemotaxis of neutrophils reported previously, we hypothesized that psoriasin might regulate other neutrophil functions such as cytokine and chemokine production, reactive oxygen species generation, and release of antimicrobial peptides.
18194266|ab|4|18194266||RESULTS|RESULTS|In the current study, we demonstrate that psoriasin activates neutrophils to produce a range of cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8/CXCL8, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha)/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4 and MIP-3alpha/CCL20.
18194266|ab|5|18194266||RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, psoriasin induces phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), both of which are required for the production of cytokines and chemokines as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of p38 and ERK inhibitors on psoriasin-mediated neutrophil activation.
18194266|ab|6|18194266||RESULTS|RESULTS|Moreover, psoriasin stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species from neutrophils, most likely via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activation.
18194266|ab|7|18194266||RESULTS|RESULTS|Finally, we demonstrate that psoriasin enhances messenger RNA expression of alpha-defensins, termed human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1 to 3, and induces their extracellular release.
18194266|ab|8|18194266||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Besides its antimicrobial properties, therefore, psoriasin may contribute to innate immunity through enhancing neutrophil host defence functions at sites of inflammation or infection.
23042787|ab|1|23042787||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Isotopic tracers have been used to examine lipid trafficking for many years, and data from those studies have typically yielded novel insight regarding the pathophysiology of dyslipidemia.
23042787|ab|2|23042787||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Previous experimental designs were suitable for studies in humans because relatively large volumes of plasma could be regularly sampled.
23042787|ab|3|23042787||BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We have expanded on the earlier logic by applying high-throughput analytical methods that require reduced sample volumes.
23042787|ab|4|23042787||OBJECTIVE|METHODS|Specifically, we have examined the possibility of coupling gel-based separations of lipoproteins (e.g., lipoprint) with LC-MS/MS analyses of complex lipid mixtures as a way to routinely measure the labeling profiles of distinct lipids in discrete lipoprotein subfractions.
23042787|ab|5|23042787||RESULTS|RESULTS|We demonstrate the ability to measure the incorporation of [U-(13)C]oleate into triglycerides (TG), PLs (PL), and cholesterol esters (CE) in VLDL, LDL, and HDL particles in mice.
23042787|ab|6|23042787||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Although rodent models of dyslipidemia are inherently different from humans because of alterations in enzyme activities and underlying metabolism, rodent models can be used to screen novel compounds for efficacy in altering a given biochemical pathway and therein enable studies of target engagement in vivo.
23042787|ab|7|23042787||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We expect that it is possible to translate our approach for application in other systems, including studies in humans.
29888676|ab|1|29888676|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Reliable reference intervals for serum progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) in healthy Chinese adults with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) are still lacking in the Chinese population.
29888676|ab|2|29888676|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The study aims to establish reference intervals for ProGRP with ECLIA in apparently healthy Chinese adults.
29888676|ab|3|29888676|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A total of 384 apparently healthy individuals from six representative geographical regions in China were enrolled: 200 males and 184 females with a mean age of 43.4+/-12.2 years, and an age range from 21 to 85 years.
29888676|ab|4|29888676|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Serum ProGRP levels were analyzed on Cobas e601 automatic immunoassay analyzer with ECLIA.
29888676|ab|5|29888676|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Reference intervals for serum ProGRP with ECLIA were determined following CLSI C28-A3 guidelines using a nonparametric method.
29888676|ab|6|29888676|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In an apparently healthy Chinese population, the reference intervals for serum ProGRP with ECLIA were 53.92 ng/L for adults aged 21-70 years and 75.69 ng/L for adults aged >70 years, respectively.
29888676|ab|7|29888676|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The reference values for serum ProGRP with ECLIA in an apparently healthy Chinese population were established according to the CLSI C28-A3 document, providing a reference for the clinical work.
29952813|ab|1|29952813|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Zumba fitness (ZF) is a well-known exercise program involving dance and fitness.
29952813|ab|2|29952813|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Despite its increasing popularity, no analysis has been conducted on studies focusing on the cardiovascular (CV) profile of women who performed this activity.
29952813|ab|3|29952813|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this systematic review is to provide insights into the impact of ZF on women's CV health.
29952813|ab|4|29952813|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Five clinical databases were searched.
29952813|ab|5|29952813|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|To be included, the articles had to include (1) women with or without CV risk factors (CVRF) and (2) CV-related outcomes resulting from a ZF program.
29952813|ab|6|29952813|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Ten studies (322 women; 181 healthy, 141 with CVRF) were included.
29952813|ab|7|29952813|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In healthy women, low absolute effect sizes for maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), anthropometric and body composition profile after 8 and 12 wk of ZF were found compared with nonparticipants.
29952813|ab|8|29952813|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Moderate to large absolute effect sizes were recorded for VO2max and body composition following 40 wk of ZF.
29952813|ab|9|29952813|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Findings proved promising but less consistent for ZF studies involving women with CVRF due to the absence of control groups.
29952813|ab|10|29952813|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Data describe ZF as feasible for healthy women and a promising fitness option for those with CVRF.
29952813|ab|11|29952813|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Because of the low quality of the studies on women with CVRF and the overall small sample size along with discrepancies such as the average length of the studies on healthy women, cautious interpretation of the findings is recommended.
29952813|ab|12|29952813|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Further investigations with a standardized design are needed to verify whether ZF may be considered as an alternative fitness option in primary prevention of CV disease in women.

27391174|ab|1|27391174||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Rapidly rising temperatures are expected to cause latitudinal and elevational range shifts as species track their optimal climate north and upward.
27391174|ab|2|27391174||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, a lack of adaptation to environmental conditions other than climate - for example photoperiod, biotic interactions, or edaphic conditions - might limit the success of immigrants in a new location despite hospitable climatic conditions.
27391174|ab|3|27391174||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Here, we present one of the first direct experimental tests of the hypothesis that warmer temperatures at northern latitudes will confer a fitness advantage to southern immigrants relative to native populations.
27391174|ab|4|27391174||METHODS|OBJECTIVE|As rates of warming in the Arctic are more than double the global average, understanding the impacts of warming in Arctic ecosystems is especially urgent.
27391174|ab|5|27391174||RESULTS|METHODS|We established experimentally warmed and nonwarmed common garden plots at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic with seeds of two forb species (Oxyria digyna and Papaver radicatum) originating from three to five populations at different latitudes across the Arctic.
27391174|ab|6|27391174||RESULTS|RESULTS|We found that plants from the local populations generally had higher survival and obtained a greater maximum size than foreign individuals, regardless of warming treatment.
27391174|ab|7|27391174||RESULTS|RESULTS|Phenological traits varied with latitude of the source population, such that southern populations demonstrated substantially delayed leaf-out and senescence relative to northern populations.
27391174|ab|8|27391174||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our results suggest that environmental conditions other than temperature may influence the ability of foreign populations and species to establish at more northerly latitudes as the climate warms, potentially leading to lags in northward range shifts for some species.
20863167|ab|1|20863167||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In assessing hazard for human health posed by newly engineered nanomaterials (ENM), approaches such as Weight of Evidence (WOE) and expert judgment are required to develop conclusions about the hazard of ENM.
20863167|ab|2|20863167||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|This is because all factors affecting hazard are not currently well defined and are often subject to different interpretation.
20863167|ab|3|20863167||OBJECTIVE|METHODS|Here we report the application of a WOE procedure to assess the potential of ENM to cause harm for human health, by integrating and combining physicochemical properties of NM and toxicity data obtained within the EU-funded Particle Risk project.
20863167|ab|4|20863167||METHODS|METHODS|The procedure was applied to carbon black (CB), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT), C60 fullerene and quantum dots (QD) ENM tested during the Particle Risk project.
20863167|ab|5|20863167||RESULTS|RESULTS|The results show that some of the investigated ENM present a relatively higher hazardousness level on the basis of the integration of their physicochemical properties and toxicological effects, and that their hazard may be ranked as follow: QD >> C60 > SWNT > CB.
20863167|ab|6|20863167||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This case study shows the utility of WOE approach to obtain a hazard ranking of ENM.

29957453|ab|1|29957453|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|A calcaneal spur, also known as enthesophyte, is an abnormal bone outgrowth at the inferior part of the calcaneus, which is the most common site of bony spur occurrence.
29957453|ab|2|29957453|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although there is consensus that a calcaneal spur is a common cause of heel pain, approximately 20% of calcaneal spurs are asymptomatic and its pathology remains not fully understood.
29957453|ab|3|29957453|PRESENTATION OF CASE|METHODS|METHODS|In this report, we present a rare case of a very large and bizarre calcaneal spur in a young adult man.
29957453|ab|4|29957453|PRESENTATION OF CASE|METHODS|METHODS|The calcaneal spur was painful, which affected his foot function and was associated with plantar fasciitis.
29957453|ab|5|29957453|PRESENTATION OF CASE|METHODS|METHODS|The spur length was measured in the radiograph and exhibited the longest calcaneal spur reported in the literature.
29957453|ab|6|29957453|PRESENTATION OF CASE|METHODS|METHODS|The patient was treated conservatively, and he fully recovered his foot function.
29957453|ab|7|29957453|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|This case was unique because although the patient presented with an extremely large unilateral calcaneal spur, he was young and did not have any chronic disease; hence, he was treated conservatively.
29957453|ab|8|29957453|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|The pain subsided and he regained full function of his foot.
29957453|ab|9|29957453|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This case questions the association between calcaneal spur length and plantar fasciitis symptoms.
29957453|ab|10|29957453|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This case confirms that the length of calcaneal spurs, even extremely long ones, is not associated with the pathology of plantar fasciitis and that surgical treatment is not necessary.

29958266|ab|2|29958266|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In the last decade, the use of intra-articular platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been proposed as an option.
29958266|ab|3|29958266|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, there is controversy about its clinical benefit and safety.
29958266|ab|4|29958266|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|To answer this question we used Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others.
29958266|ab|5|29958266|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed data of primary studies, conducted a meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach.
29958266|ab|6|29958266|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|We identified twelve systematic reviews including four studies overall, of which all corresponded to randomized trials.
29958266|ab|7|29958266|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|We concluded that intra-articular injection of platelet-rich plasma might slightly decrease joint pain and improve patient satisfaction,vut it is not clear whether it has any effect on functionality because the certainty of the evidence is very low.
29958266|ab|8|29958266|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|As for the adverse effects, if they exist, they would be non-severe and self-limited.
29909568|ab|1|29909568|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The association between the checkpoint kinase 2*1100delC (CHEK2*1100delC) and breast cancer has been extensively explored.
29909568|ab|2|29909568|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In light of the recent publication of studies on these specific findings, particularly regarding male patients with breast cancer, we performed an updated meta-analysis to investigate a more reliable estimate.

29909568|ab|5|29909568|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Meta-analysis results suggested that 1100delC contributed to an increased breast cancer risk in overall populations (OR 2.89; 95% CI 2.63-3.16).
29909568|ab|6|29909568|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Subgroup analysis found ORs of 3.13 (95% CI 1.94-5.07) for male breast cancer, 2.88 (95% CI 2.63-3.16) for female breast cancer, 2.87 (95% CI 1.85-4.47) for early-onset breast cancer, 2.92 (95% CI 2.65-3.22) for invasive breast cancer, and 3.21 (95% CI 2.41-4.29) for familial breast cancer.
29909568|ab|7|29909568|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The sensitivity analysis suggested that results of this meta-analysis were generally robust.

29956092|ab|2|29956092|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We examined regional variation in performance for Commission on Cancer breast quality measures and its impact on overall survival (OS) for those measures that have been shown to impact OS.
29956092|ab|3|29956092|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Six breast quality measures were analyzed using the National Cancer Data Base from 2014 to 2015, and a multivariable model was used to assess performance for each measure by region.
29956092|ab|4|29956092|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine OS between high- and low-performing centers from 2007 to 2012.
29956092|ab|5|29956092|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Overall, 305,391 women had surgery at 1322 institutions in nine US regions; 90.8% underwent needle biopsy (range 86.0-92.6% between regions, p < 0.01), 69.8% had breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for stage 0-II cancer (60.9-79.3%, p < 0.01), 85.2% aged < 70 years had radiation therapy (RT) after BCS (79.6-90.8%, p < 0.01), 78.3% of women with four or more positive nodes had post-mastectomy RT (70.9-84.5%, p < 0.01), 90.9% with hormone receptor (HR)-positive stage IB-III cancer had hormone therapy (83.7-95.1%, p < 0.01), and 89.4% aged < 70 years with HR-negative stage IB-III cancer had chemotherapy (87.6-91.4%, p < 0.01).
29956092|ab|6|29956092|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Multivariate analyses adjusted for patient and facility factors found that region was the only consistent predictor of non-compliance across measures.

22198709|ab|1|22198709||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Many dental bleaching techniques are now available, several of them using a laser source.
22198709|ab|2|22198709||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, the literature on the exact role of coherent light in the biochemical reaction of the whitening process is very discordant.
22198709|ab|3|22198709||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The aims of this in vitro study were: (1) to compare two different laser sources, a KTP laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and a diode laser with a wavelength of 808 nm, during dental bleaching, and (2) to investigate the relationships among changes in gel temperature, tooth shade and hydrogen peroxide (HP) concentration during laser irradiation.
22198709|ab|4|22198709||METHODS|METHODS|Altogether, 116 bovine teeth were bleached using a 30% HP gel, some of them with gel only and others with gel plus one of the two lasers (532 or 808 nm) at two different powers (2 and 4 W).
22198709|ab|5|22198709||METHODS|METHODS|The KTP laser produced a significant shade variation with a minimal temperature increase.
22198709|ab|6|22198709||RESULTS|RESULTS|The diode laser led to a higher temperature increase with a greater reduction in HP concentration, but the change in shade was only statistically significant with a power of 4 W.
22198709|ab|7|22198709||RESULTS|RESULTS|At a power of 2 W, the KTP laser caused a greater change in shade than the diode laser.
22198709|ab|8|22198709||RESULTS|RESULTS|No significant correlations were found among temperature, HP concentration and shade variation.
22198709|ab|9|22198709||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The KTP laser appears to provide better results with less dangerous thermal increases than the diode laser.
22198709|ab|10|22198709||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This might call into question most of the literature affirming that the action of laser bleaching is by increasing the gel temperature and, consequently, the speed of the redox reaction.

29952691|ab|1|29952691|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Exposure to high dose ionizing radiation leads to premature cell senescence and suppression of cell proliferation.
29952691|ab|2|29952691|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|In contrast, low dose and low dose-rate gamma-irradiation can lead to stimulation of cell proliferation.
29952691|ab|3|29952691|PURPOSE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We aimed to examine whether the low dose radiation-induced proliferation of normal human fibroblasts can lead to a progressive depletion of proliferation potential and to an early onset of senescence.
29952691|ab|4|29952691|MATERIALS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Normal human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELF-104) at passage 22-24 were gamma-irradiated with doses of 0 (sham-irradiation), 10, 30, 50, 90, 120, 150, 200, 500 mGy as well as 1 and 2 Gy.
29952691|ab|5|29952691|MATERIALS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|After irradiation, the fraction of cells positively stained for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity was measured weekly until the cell culture completely ceased to proliferate.
29952691|ab|6|29952691|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We show that single irradiation of HELF-104 cells with 30 and 50 mGy resulted in deceleration of senescence.
29952691|ab|7|29952691|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The suppression of senescence was observed during almost the entire length of the study up to a complete arrest of cell growth.
29952691|ab|8|29952691|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Our data, together with the previously published observation of delayed stimulation of proliferation in HELF-104 cells exposed to 30 mGy, suggest that low dose gamma-irradiation can increase the overall proliferative potential of normal human fibroblasts.
29948752|ab|1|29948752|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Acute myocardial infarction (MI) and the ensuing ischemic heart disease are approaching epidemic state.
29948752|ab|2|29948752|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Unfortunately, no definitive therapies are available and human regenerative therapies have conflicting results.
29948752|ab|3|29948752|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Limited stem cell retention following intracoronary administration has reduced the clinical efficacy of this novel therapy.
29948752|ab|4|29948752|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Cathelicidin related antimicrobial peptides (CRAMPs) enhance chemotactic responsiveness of BMSPCs to low SDF-1 gradients, suggesting a potential role in BMSPCs engraftment.
29948752|ab|5|29948752|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Here, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of CRAMPs in the context of BMSPCs recruitment and retention via intracardiac delivery of CRAMP-treated BMSPCs or CRAMP-releasing hydrogels (HG) post-AMI.
29948752|ab|6|29948752|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|For cell transplantation experiments, mice were randomized into 3 groups: MI followed by injection of PBS, BMMNCs alone, and BMMNCs pre-incubated with CRAMP.
29948752|ab|7|29948752|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|During the in vivo HG studies, BM GFP chimera mice were randomized into 4 groups: MI followed by injection of HG alone, HG + SDF-1, HG + CRAMP, HG + SDF-1 + CRAMP.

29945791|ab|1|29945791|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Alpha (8-14Hz) oscillatory power is linked to cortical excitability and corresponding modulations of sensory evoked potentials and perceptual detection performance.
29945791|ab|2|29945791|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In somatosensory cortex (S1), negative linear and inverted U-shape relationships exist, whereas its effect on the primary motor cortex (M1) is hardly known.
29945791|ab|3|29945791|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We used real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1 to characterize the relationship between spontaneous sensorimotor mu-alpha power fluctuations at rest and corticospinal excitability.
29945791|ab|4|29945791|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In 16 subjects, mu-alpha power was continuously monitored over the left sensorimotor cortex, and each 10%-percentile bin of the individual mu-alpha power distribution was repeatedly targeted in pseudorandomized order by single-pulse TMS of left M1, measuring motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the contralateral hand.
29945791|ab|5|29945791|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|We found a weak positive relationship between mu-alpha power and MEP amplitude.
29945791|ab|6|29945791|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Sensorimotor mu-alpha power may reflect a net facilitation or disinhibition of M1, possibly resulting from mu-alpha based suppression of excitatory and inhibitory input from S1.
24211653|ab|1|24211653||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in higher brain functions altered in schizophrenia.
24211653|ab|2|24211653||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Classical antipsychotic drugs modulate information processing in cortico-limbic circuits via dopamine D2 receptor blockade in nucleus accumbens (NAc) whereas atypical antipsychotic drugs preferentially target cortical serotonin (5-HT) receptors.
24211653|ab|3|24211653||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The brain networks involved in the therapeutic action of atypical drugs are not fully understood.
24211653|ab|4|24211653||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Previous work indicated that medial PFC (mPFC) pyramidal neurons projecting to ventral tegmental area express 5-HT2A receptors suggesting that atypical antipsychotic drugs modulate dopaminergic activity distally, via 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2A-R) blockade in PFC.
24211653|ab|5|24211653||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Since the mPFC also projects heavily to NAc, we examined whether NAc-projecting pyramidal neurons also express 5-HT2A-R.
24211653|ab|6|24211653||METHODS|METHODS|Using a combination of retrograde tracing experiments and in situ hybridization we report that a substantial proportion of mPFC-NAc pyramidal neurons in rat brain express 5-HT2A-R mRNA in a layer- and area-specific manner (up to 68% in layer V of contralateral cingulate).
24211653|ab|7|24211653||RESULTS|METHODS|The functional relevance of 5-HT2A-R to modulate mPFC-NAc projections was examined in dual-probe microdialysis experiments.
24211653|ab|8|24211653||RESULTS|RESULTS|The application of the preferential 5-HT2A-R agonist DOI into mPFC enhanced glutamate release locally (+66 +/- 18%) and in NAc (+74 +/- 12%) indicating that cortical 5-HT2A-R activation augments glutamatergic transmission in NAc.
24211653|ab|9|24211653||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Since NAc integrates glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs, blockade of 5-HT2A-R by atypical drugs may reduce cortical excitatory inputs onto GABAergic neurons of NAc, adding to dopamine D2 receptor blockade.
24211653|ab|10|24211653||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Together with previous observations, the present results suggest that atypical antipsychotic drugs may control the activity of the mesolimbic pathway at cell body and terminal level.
29957307|ab|1|29957307|INTRODUCTION|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The 2-fold purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of acid etching and calcium chloride immersion on removal torque and the bone-cutting ability of orthodontic mini-implants (OMIs).
29957307|ab|2|29957307|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|For the removal torque part of the study, 3 types of OMIs (titanium alloy) were evaluated in a rabbit model: OMIs with acid surface etching with and without calcium chloride immersion (ECG and EG, respectively) and a control group (CG), in which the OMIs had an untreated, machined surface.
29957307|ab|3|29957307|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We inserted 126 OMIs (42 OMIs per type) into both tibias of 21 male rabbits (5 months of age) with body weights of 3.0 to 3.5 kg.
29957307|ab|4|29957307|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Removal torque was evaluated after 1, 4, and 7 weeks.
29957307|ab|5|29957307|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|To determine the OMIs' bone-cutting ability, total insertion time to place an OMI 6 mm into artificial bone was measured (6 OMIs per group).
29957307|ab|6|29957307|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Removal torque values for the EG (3.97 +/- 0.52 Ncm) and ECG (4.21 +/- 0.44 Ncm) were statistically and significantly higher than those of the CG (3.02 +/- 0.53 Ncm) 1 week after implantation (P <0.05).
29957307|ab|7|29957307|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The ECG (6.54 +/- 0.50, 6.61 +/- 0.66 Ncm) showed the highest removal torque value followed by the EG (5.68 +/- 0.58, 5.89 +/- 0.70 Ncm) and CG (3.43 +/- 0.62, 3.38 +/- 0.54 Ncm) at 4 and 7 weeks after implantation (P <0.05).
29957307|ab|8|29957307|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Removal torque did not change over time with the CG, but with the ECG and EG, it was significantly higher in weeks 4 and 7 than in week 1 (P <0.05).
29957307|ab|9|29957307|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Total insertion time was significantly greater for the EG than for the ECG and CG (P <0.05).
29957307|ab|10|29957307|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Treating OMIs with a calcium chloride solution improved the initial bone reaction by preventing contamination of the implant surface, and increasing the surface roughness of OMIs by acid etching enhanced their stability without decreasing the bone-cutting ability compared with OMIs without surface treatment.

19281795|ab|2|19281795||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In obesity, adipose lipin-1 expression is decreased.
19281795|ab|3|19281795||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although lipin-1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity, the mechanism is still not clear.
19281795|ab|4|19281795||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Since TNF-alpha is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, here we investigated the role of TNF-alpha on lipin-1 expression in adipocytes.
19281795|ab|5|19281795||RESULTS|RESULTS|Quantitative PCR studies showed that TNF-alpha suppressed both lipin-1A and -1B isoform expression in time- and dose-dependent manners in mature 3T3-L1 adpocytes.

17448455|ab|1|17448455||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The central nervous system (CNS) has been referred to as the "immunological privileged site".
17448455|ab|2|17448455||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, it is now clear that the privileged status of the CNS is a result of a balance between immune privilege and effective response.
17448455|ab|3|17448455||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In vitro, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability to differentiate into neurons.
17448455|ab|4|17448455||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Based on this biological attribute we gain the possibility by means of using MSCs as the donors to develop a future cell therapy in clinical application.
17448455|ab|5|17448455||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|But using MSCs as donor cells inevitably raises the question as to whether these donor cells would be immunogenic, and if so, would they be rejected after transplantation.

17880059|ab|2|17880059||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The physical and spectroscopic properties of [Pt(Me(2)bzimpy)Cl]+ and [Pt(tpy)Cl]+ intercalated in ZrP were investigated by X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron, infrared, absorption, and luminescence spectroscopies.
17880059|ab|3|17880059||OBJECTIVE|RESULTS|In contrast to unintercalated complexes in fluid solution, which do not emit at room temperature, both intercalated materials in the solid state and in colloidal suspensions exhibit intense emissions at room temperature.
17880059|ab|4|17880059||RESULTS|RESULTS|A [Pt(Me(2)bzimpy)Cl]+-exchanged ZrP colloidal methanol suspension gives rise to an emission at 612 nm that originates from a lowest (3)MMLCT[dsigma*(Pt) --> pi*(tpy)] state (MMLCT = metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer) characteristic of strong Pt...Pt interactions.

29958226|ab|1|29958226|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In patients with an unstable cervical spine, maintenance of cervical immobilization during tracheal intubation is important.
29958226|ab|2|29958226|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In McGrath videolaryngoscopic intubation, lifting of the blade to raise the epiglottis is needed to visualize the glottis, but in patients with an unstable cervical spine, this can cause cervical spine movement.
29958226|ab|3|29958226|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|By contrast, the Optiscope, a rigid video-stylet, does not require raising of the epiglottis during tracheal intubation.
29958226|ab|4|29958226|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|We therefore hypothesized that the Optiscope would produce less cervical spine movement than the McGrath videolaryngoscope during tracheal intubation.
29958226|ab|5|29958226|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|OBJECTIVE|The aim of this study was to compare the Optiscope with the McGrath videolaryngoscope with respect to cervical spine motion during intubation in patients with simulated cervical immobilization.
29958226|ab|6|29958226|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The primary outcome of the study was the extent of cervical spine motion at the occiput-C1, C1-C2, and C2-C5 segments.
29958226|ab|7|29958226|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|In this randomized crossover study, the cervical spine angle was measured before and during tracheal intubation using either the Optiscope or the McGrath videolaryngoscope in 21 patients with simulated cervical immobilization.
29958226|ab|8|29958226|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Cervical spine motion was defined as the change in angle at each cervical segment during tracheal intubation.
29958226|ab|9|29958226|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was significantly less cervical spine motion at the occiput-C1 segment using the Optiscope rather than the McGrath videolaryngoscope (mean [98.33% CI]: 4.7 degrees [2.4-7.0] vs 10.4 degrees [8.1-12.7]; mean difference [98.33% CI]: -5.7 degrees [-7.5 to -3.9]).
29958226|ab|10|29958226|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There were also fewer cervical spinal motions at the C1-C2 and C2-C5 segments using the Optiscope (mean difference versus the McGrath videolaryngoscope [98.33% CI]: -2.4 degrees [-3.7 to -1.2]) and -3.7 degrees [-5.9 to -1.4], respectively).

29941296|ab|5|29941296|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Patients were randomly assigned to risperidone or aripiprazole.
29941296|ab|6|29941296|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|From this randomization, 75 patients and 75 healthy volunteers that matched with the selected patients were picked for entry in this study.
29941296|ab|7|29941296|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Serum concentrations of 21 cytokines/chemokines were measured at baseline and 3months following the initiation of antipsychotic medication.
29941296|ab|8|29941296|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Those patients who were randomly assigned to risperidone had higher levels of IL-8 (p=0.000) and MIP-1beta (p=0.007) than healthy volunteers at baseline, whereas no differences were found between patients initially assigned to aripiprazole and healthy volunteers.
29941296|ab|9|29941296|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Three months following the onset of medication several cytokines decreased significantly: IL-8, MIP-1beta, Fractalkine, TNF-alpha, IL-7, IL-13, IL-17alpha, IL-23, IL-21 (all ps<0.01).

29941296|ab|11|29941296|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The effect size of the two antipsychotics was similar, except for TNF-alpha, IL-13, IL-17alpha and Fractalkine, in which aripiprazole seems to have a greater effect size than risperidone, whereas risperidone seems to have a greater effect size than aripiprazole on MIP-1beta.
29941296|ab|12|29941296|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This is the first study that has compared the immunomodulatory effect of risperidone and aripiprazole, finding that the anti-inflammatory effect of both treatments was similar.
29954455|ab|1|29954455|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Chondroid lipoma, first described in 1993 by Meis and Enzinger, is a very rare lipomatous tumor.
29954455|ab|2|29954455|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Because it is a benign tumor, it does not require radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or extensive resection.
29954455|ab|3|29954455|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, histologically, it is often confused with a sarcoma.
29954455|ab|4|29954455|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is crucial to differentiate chondroid lipoma from sarcoma to avoid choosing an inappropriate treatment strategy.
29954455|ab|5|29954455|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although MRI, radiography, and ultrasound have been used to evaluate chondroid lipomas, imaging cannot accurately differentiate chondroid lipoma from sarcoma.
29954455|ab|6|29954455|CASE PRESENTATION|METHODS|METHODS|A 39-year-old man presented to a local clinic with a 1-month history of a painless mass in his left neck.
29954455|ab|7|29954455|CASE PRESENTATION|METHODS|METHODS|Results of a needle biopsy suggested an atypical lipomatous tumor, and the patient was referred to our hospital.
29954455|ab|8|29954455|CASE PRESENTATION|METHODS|METHODS|Physical examination revealed a hard and mobile mass in the left neck.
29954455|ab|9|29954455|CASE PRESENTATION|METHODS|METHODS|Plain X-ray radiographs showed an absence of calcification in the soft tissue mass.
29954455|ab|10|29954455|CASE PRESENTATION|METHODS|METHODS|MRI revealed a well-defined and lobulated mass, and on T1-weighted images, the lesion showed heterogeneity, with higher signal intensity than that of muscle.
29954455|ab|11|29954455|CASE PRESENTATION|METHODS|METHODS|On T2-weighted images, the septum had low-signal intensity.
29954455|ab|12|29954455|CASE PRESENTATION|METHODS|METHODS|On T2-weighted fat-suppressed images, the signal of the mass was completely suppressed.
29954455|ab|13|29954455|CASE PRESENTATION|METHODS|METHODS|The SUVmax of the mass on FDG PET was 1.84.
29954455|ab|14|29954455|CASE PRESENTATION|METHODS|METHODS|An additional needle biopsy was performed, and on the basis of the results, we arrived at a diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma.

19105972|ab|2|19105972||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study investigates the applicability of nuclear medicine and radiological techniques to monitor growth factor retention profiles and subsequent effects on bone formation.
19105972|ab|3|19105972||METHODS|METHODS|Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2, 6.5 microg/scaffold) was incorporated into a sustained release vehicle consisting of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres embedded in a poly(propylene fumarate) scaffold surrounded by a gelatin hydrogel and implanted subcutaneously and in 5-mm segmental femoral defects in 9 rats for a period of 56 days.
19105972|ab|4|19105972||METHODS|METHODS|To determine the pharmacokinetic profile, BMP-2 was radiolabeled with (125)I and the local retention of (125)I-BMP-2 was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), scintillation probes and ex vivo scintillation analysis.
19105972|ab|5|19105972||METHODS|METHODS|Bone formation was monitored by micro-computed tomography (microCT).
19105972|ab|6|19105972||RESULTS|METHODS|The scaffolds released BMP-2 in a sustained fashion over the 56-day implantation period.
19105972|ab|7|19105972||RESULTS|RESULTS|A good correlation between the SPECT and scintillation probe measurements was found and there were no significant differences between the non-invasive and ex-vivo counting method after 8 weeks of follow up.
19105972|ab|8|19105972||RESULTS|RESULTS|SPECT analysis of the total body and thyroid counts showed a limited accumulation of (125)I within the body.
19105972|ab|9|19105972||RESULTS|RESULTS|Ectopic bone formation was induced in the scaffolds and the femur defects healed completely.
19105972|ab|10|19105972||RESULTS|RESULTS|In vivo microCT imaging detected the first signs of bone formation at days 14 and 28 for the orthotopic and ectopic implants, respectively, and provided a detailed profile of the bone formation rate.

26093313|ab|1|26093313||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This report is a comparative evaluation on the interaction of dorzolamide (DZA) with bovine and human carbonic anhydrase II (bCA II and hCA II, respectively) using fluorimetry, UV-vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy as well as molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies.
26093313|ab|2|26093313||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Fluorescence data obtained at different temperatures indicated that DZA quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of both enzymes through a static mechanism.
26093313|ab|3|26093313||METHODS|RESULTS|Thermodynamic analysis of the quenching data revealed that hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions play important roles in drug binding.
26093313|ab|4|26093313||RESULTS|RESULTS|Calculations of the protein surface hydrophobicity (PSH) index, using 1-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonate, also indicated a decrease in PSH of the hCA II and minor increase in PSH value of the bCA II upon drug binding.
26093313|ab|5|26093313||RESULTS|RESULTS|The results of far- and near-UV CD experiments showed some alterations in the secondary and tertiary structures of both enzymes upon ligation.
26093313|ab|6|26093313||RESULTS|RESULTS|The structural changes induced by drug binding caused more reduction in the catalytic activity of hCA II than bCA II.
26093313|ab|7|26093313||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Based on the experimental data and the possible binding mode revealed by molecular docking and molecular dynamic studies, we concluded that DZA binds stronger to hCA II active site cavity compared to bCA II.
23261786|ab|1|23261786||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study investigated the generalization of deferred imitation in 6-, 9-, and 12-month-old infants across auditory and visual contexts.
23261786|ab|2|23261786||BACKGROUND|METHODS|The task involved testing for the imitation of demonstrated actions on an animal puppet 24h later.
23261786|ab|3|23261786||METHODS|METHODS|There were two independent variables defined by the background music and room of the infant's home on the test day relative to the music and room present on the demonstration day.
23261786|ab|4|23261786||METHODS|RESULTS|6-month-olds generalized imitation only when the music and room on the test day were identical to their learning environment 24h earlier.
23261786|ab|5|23261786||RESULTS|RESULTS|9-month-olds were able to generalize deferred imitation across a change in music but not a change in room.
23261786|ab|6|23261786||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|12-month-olds were able to defer imitation across both a change in the room with the same music as well as a change in both the room and music.
23261786|ab|7|23261786||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|These results reveal that the similarity between the contextual conditions of encoding and retrieval across multiple contexts determine whether infants generalize and, furthermore, the necessity of such a similarity decreases with age.

17719561|ab|1|17719561||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Endothelial dysfunction is thought to be a major cause of vascular complications in diabetes.
17719561|ab|2|17719561||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Our research shows that ghrelin attenuates high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV-304).
17719561|ab|3|17719561||BACKGROUND|RESULTS|Exposure to glucose (33.3mM) for 72 h caused a significant increase in apoptosis, as evaluated by TUNEL and flow cytometry, but pretreatment of ghrelin (10(-7)M) eliminated high glucose-induced apoptosis in ECV-304.
17719561|ab|4|17719561||RESULTS|RESULTS|Ghrelin also prevented the induction of caspase-3 activation, in cells incubated with glucose (33.3 mM).
17719561|ab|5|17719561||RESULTS|RESULTS|Exposure of cells to ghrelin (10(-7)M) caused rapid activation of Akt.
17719561|ab|6|17719561||RESULTS|RESULTS|PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 attenuated ghrelin's inhibitory effect on caspase-3 activity.
17719561|ab|7|17719561||RESULTS|RESULTS|Ghrelin protected endothelial cells from high glucose by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.
17719561|ab|8|17719561||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Results of our study indicate that ghrelin inhibits both high glucose-induced apoptosis via PI3K/Akt pathway and ROS production in ECV-304.

29954409|ab|1|29954409|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Implementation is proposed to be a multiphase, multilevel process.
29954409|ab|2|29954409|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|After a period of exploration, an adoption decision is made, typically at the upper management or policy level.
29954409|ab|3|29954409|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Nevertheless, movement through each of the subsequent phases of the implementation process involves clinicians or providers at the individual level to adopt the innovation and then change their behavior to use/deliver the innovation.
29954409|ab|4|29954409|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Multiple behavioral change theories propose that intentions are a critical determinant of implementation behavior.
29954409|ab|5|29954409|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, there is a need for the development and testing of pragmatic measures of providers' intentions to use a specific innovation or evidence-based practice (EBP).
29954409|ab|6|29954409|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Nine items were developed to assess providers' intentions to use a specific innovation or EBP.
29954409|ab|7|29954409|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Motivational interviewing was the EBP in the study.
29954409|ab|8|29954409|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Items were administered, as part of larger survey, to 179 providers across 38 substance use disorder treatment (SUDT) programs within five agencies in California, USA.
29954409|ab|9|29954409|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Rasch analysis was conducted using RUMM2030 software to assess the items, their overall fit to the Rasch model, the response scale used, individual item fit, differential item functioning (DIF), and person separation.
29954409|ab|10|29954409|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Following a stepwise process, the scale was reduced from nine items to three items to increase the feasibility and acceptability of the scale while maintaining suitable psychometric properties.
29954409|ab|11|29954409|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The three-item unidimensional scale showed good person separation (PSI = .872), no disordering of thresholds, and no evidence of uniform or non-uniform DIF.
29954409|ab|12|29954409|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Rasch analysis supported the viability of the scale as a measure of implementation intentions.
29954409|ab|13|29954409|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The Measure of Innovation-Specific Implementation Intentions (MISII) is a sound measure of providers' intentions to use a specific innovation or EBP.

22166810|ab|1|22166810||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Smoke from biomass fuels is a risk factor for pneumonia, the leading cause of child death worldwide.
22166810|ab|2|22166810||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although particulate matter (PM) is the metric of choice for studying the health effects of biomass smoke, measuring children's PM exposure is difficult.
22166810|ab|3|22166810||OBJECTIVE|BACKGROUND|Carbon monoxide (CO), which is easier to measure, can be used as a proxy for PM exposure.
22166810|ab|4|22166810||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We measured the exposure of children <= 5 years of age in The Gambia to CO using small, passive, color stain diffusion tubes.
22166810|ab|5|22166810||METHODS|METHODS|We conducted multiple CO measurements on a subset of children to measure day-to-day exposure variability.
22166810|ab|6|22166810||METHODS|METHODS|Usual CO exposure was modeled using a mixed effects model, which also included individual and household level exposure predictors.
22166810|ab|7|22166810||RESULTS|RESULTS|Mean measured CO exposure for 1181 children (n=2263 measurements) was 1.04 +/- 1.46 p.p.m., indicating that the Gambian children in this study on average have a relatively low CO exposure.
22166810|ab|8|22166810||RESULTS|RESULTS|However, 25% of children had exposures of 1.3 p.p.m. or higher.
22166810|ab|9|22166810||RESULTS|RESULTS|CO exposure was higher during the rainy months (1.33 +/- 1.62 p.p.m.).
22166810|ab|10|22166810||RESULTS|RESULTS|Burning insect coils, using charcoal, and measurement done in the rainy season were associated with higher exposure.
22166810|ab|11|22166810||CONCLUSIONS|RESULTS|A parsimonious model with fuel, season, and other PM sources as covariates explained 39% of between-child variation in exposure and helped remove within-child variability.
26270190|ab|1|26270190||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Attentional selection in visual search paradigms and perceptual selection in bistable perception paradigms show functional similarities.
26270190|ab|2|26270190||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|For example, both are sensitive to trial history: They are biased toward previously selected targets or interpretations.
26270190|ab|3|26270190||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|We investigated whether priming by target selection in visual search and sensory memory for bistable perception are related.
26270190|ab|4|26270190||METHODS|METHODS|We did this by presenting two trial types to observers.
26270190|ab|5|26270190||METHODS|METHODS|We presented either ambiguous spheres that rotated over a central axis and could be perceived as rotating in one of two directions, or search displays in which the unambiguously rotating target and distractor spheres closely resembled the two possible interpretations of the ambiguous stimulus.
26270190|ab|6|26270190||OBJECTIVE|METHODS|We interleaved both trial types within experiments, to see whether priming by target selection during search trials would affect the perceptual outcome of bistable perception and, conversely, whether sensory memory during bistable perception would affect target selection times during search.
26270190|ab|7|26270190||RESULTS|RESULTS|Whereas we found intertrial repetition effects among consecutive search trials and among consecutive bistable trials, we did not find cross-paradigm effects.
26270190|ab|8|26270190||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Thus, even though we could ascertain that our experiments robustly elicited processes of both search priming and sensory memory for bistable perception, these same experiments revealed no interaction between the two.

29958197|ab|5|29958197|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Correlation between ULDCT and SDCT was assessed by interclass correlation coefficiency (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis.
29958197|ab|6|29958197|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Excellent correlation was seen between MBIR with conventional setting on ULDCT and FBP with smooth kernel on SDCT (ICC, 0.97; bias, -0.31%) and between MBIR with lung setting on ULDCT and FBP with sharp kernel on SDCT (ICC, 0.82; bias, -2.10%).
29958197|ab|7|29958197|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Model-based iterative reconstruction improved the agreement between ULDCT and SDCT on emphysema quantification.

29894433|ab|1|29894433|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC) is a rare cutaneous neoplasm with high potential for morbidity and mortality.
29894433|ab|2|29894433|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Due to its rarity, there is a paucity of data profiling diagnosis, work-up, and management.
29894433|ab|3|29894433|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To consolidate reported information on demographics, diagnostics, clinical behavior, treatment modalities, and patient outcomes in EPC to provide a reference tool to optimize diagnosis and management.
29894433|ab|4|29894433|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A comprehensive PubMed search was performed from 1963 to November 2017 using PRISMA guidelines.
29894433|ab|5|29894433|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|This yielded 155 articles detailing 206 cases of porocarcinoma.
29894433|ab|6|29894433|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Eccrine porocarcinoma most often presents in elderly patients on the head and neck or lower limbs.
29894433|ab|7|29894433|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Metastatic disease at presentation is not uncommon (22%).
29894433|ab|8|29894433|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Primary tumor location is significantly correlated with presence of metastasis (p = .038).
29894433|ab|9|29894433|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The most common treatment is excision followed by Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), although the outcomes after MMS were superior to those after surgical excision.
29894433|ab|10|29894433|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This systematic review of individual patient data reveals that all patients should have a histological diagnosis with imaging considered for high-risk cases.

29924774|ab|3|29924774|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|The study was aimed at investigating a possibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination for assessment of patency of tibial arteries and quantitative assessment of perfusion of crural muscles in patient with occlusive lesions of lower-limb arteries.
29924774|ab|4|29924774|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|We examined a total of 30 patients presenting with atherosclerotic-genesis occlusive lesions of lower limb arteries and symptomatic intermittent claudication.

29924774|ab|6|29924774|PATIENTS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|All patients were subjected to quantitative analysis of crural muscle perfusion in the pre- and postoperative periods, determining the time of onset of contrast medium accumulation and the time to the peak of intensity.
29924774|ab|7|29924774|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination demonstrated that in patients with occlusive lesions of lower-limb arteries the start of contrast medium accumulation appeared to occur later than in apparently healthy people: on second 30-88, depending on the degree of limb ischaemia.
29924774|ab|8|29924774|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The contrasting time-to-peak was also increased (from 36 to 120 s).

29924774|ab|10|29924774|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic examination is currently the only non-invasive, safe method of determining perfusion of crural muscles, which may be used many times for assessment of viability of the ischaemised extremity, as well as for assessment of efficacy of the treatment performed.
20409550|ab|1|20409550||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|The use of swim fins has become popular in various water sport activities.
20409550|ab|2|20409550||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|While numerous models of swim fin with various innovative shapes have been subjectively designed, the exact influence of the fin characteristics on swimming performance is still much debated, and remains difficult to quantify.
20409550|ab|3|20409550||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|To date, the most common approach for evaluating swim fin propulsion is based on the study of "swimmer-fins" as a global system, where physiological and/or biomechanical responses are considered.
20409550|ab|4|20409550||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|However, reproducible swimming technique is difficult (or even impossible) to obtain on human body and may lead to discrepancies in data acquired between trials.
20409550|ab|5|20409550||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In this study, we present and validate a new automat called HERMES which enables an evaluation of various swim fins during an adjustable, standardized and reproducible motion.
20409550|ab|6|20409550||METHODS|METHODS|This test bench reliably and accurately reproduces human fin-swimming motions, and gives resulting dynamic measurements at the ankle joint.
20409550|ab|7|20409550||METHODS|METHODS|Seven fins with various geometrical and mechanical characteristics were tested.
20409550|ab|8|20409550||METHODS|METHODS|For each swim fin, ankle force and hydromechanical efficiency (useful mechanical power output divided by mechanical power input delivered by the motors) were calculated.
20409550|ab|9|20409550||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Efficiencies reported in our study were high (close to 70% for some swim fins) over a narrow range of Strouhal number (St) and peaks within the interval 0.2<St<0.4, as shown in previous studies on flying or swimming animals.
20409550|ab|10|20409550||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Therefore, an interesting prospect in this work would be to accurately study the impact of adjustable fin kinematics and material (design and mechanical properties) on the wake structure and on efficiency.

29898446|ab|7|29898446|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Compared to the controls, the ALS patients displayed significantly increased levels of NF-L; these values were negatively correlated with the ALSFRS-r score and positively correlated with the decrease in ALSFRS-r score, DPR, and UMN score.
29898446|ab|8|29898446|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was no correlation between levels of NF-L and duration.
29898446|ab|9|29898446|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In addition, the cumulative survival rate in ALS patients with a low level of NF-L was higher than in patients with a high level of NF-L.

29885870|ab|1|29885870|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is extremely important to not only address the short-term success following endoscopic correction of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) but also the long-term efficacy and safety of the tissue augmenting substance utilized for endoscopic correction.
29885870|ab|2|29885870|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This study retrospectively evaluated all cases of ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction following endoscopic treatment of VUR over the last 5 years utilizing two tissue augmenting substances, with special emphasis on the safety of Vantris((R)), and performed clinical and histological review of these patients.
29885870|ab|3|29885870|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The study population comprised 2495 patients who underwent endoscopic correction of VUR utilizing Deflux((R)) (1790) and Vantris((R)) (705).
29885870|ab|4|29885870|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin & eosin and trichrome, and examined under a light microscope.
29885870|ab|5|29885870|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Nine primary obstructive megaureters after ureteral re-implantation served as controls.
29885870|ab|6|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Nine (0.5%) children (three female and six male) in the Deflux group and nine (1.3%) (five females and four males) in the Vantris group developed UVJ obstruction and required ureteral re-implantation.
29885870|ab|7|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Obstruction developed during the period ranging 2-49 months (average 16 months) following endoscopic correction.
29885870|ab|8|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The primary reflux grade was III in seven, IV in six, and V in six children.
29885870|ab|9|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The mean volume of the injected material in all obstructed patients was 1.2 +/- 0.6 cc (mean +/- SD).
29885870|ab|10|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Histopathological analysis revealed a pseudocapsule composed of fibrous tissue and foreign-body giant cells surrounding the Vantris implant in all patients.
29885870|ab|11|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The distal part of the ureters demonstrated significant ureteral dilatation without ureteral fibrosis.
29885870|ab|12|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In all patients, additional biopsies from the muscularis propria adjacent to the injection site were examined and showed no significant abnormalities.
29885870|ab|13|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|There was an increased collagen deposition in the juxtavesical segment of the obstructive ureters following Deflux and Vantris injections, and of primary obstructive megaureter.
29885870|ab|14|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|No significant difference was found in the tissue response between Deflux and Vantris patients and controls.
29885870|ab|15|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Statistical analysis of the nonhomogeneous population demonstrated higher obstruction rates in patients from the Vantris group.
29885870|ab|16|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|However, no statistical difference was demonstrated regarding the obstruction rate in the homogenous group with relation to gender, age and reflux grade group of patients.
29885870|ab|17|29885870|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Moreover, univariate analysis revealed that Grade V reflux, the presence of beak sign on the reviewed pretreatment, and inflamed bladder mucosa upon injection were significant independent risk factors leading to obstruction.
29885870|ab|18|29885870|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This study suggested that the underlining ureteral pathology lead to UVJ obstruction following Vantris injection.
29885870|ab|19|29885870|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|There was increased collagen deposition in the juxtavesical segment of the obstructive ureters following Vantris injection.
29885870|ab|20|29885870|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Furthermore, these findings were similar to those discovered in patients who underwent endoscopic correction with Deflux, and in patients who required ureteral reimplantation due to primary obstructive megaureter.
29885870|ab|21|29885870|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Additional biopsies from the muscularis propria adjacent to the injection site showed no significant abnormalities, ironing out the fact that Vantris did not led to adverse tissue reaction following injection.
29885870|ab|22|29885870|DISCUSSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Univariate analysis further ironed out the hypothesis that underlying ureteral pathology was responsible for the increased incidence of UVJ obstruction and demonstrated that Grade V reflux, the presence of beak sign on the reviewed pretreatment VCUG, and inflamed bladder mucosa upon injection were significant independent risk factors leading to obstruction.
29885870|ab|23|29885870|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Data showed that Vantris injection did not lead to any different ureteral fibrosis or inflammatory changes to the tissue augmenting substances utilized in past and present clinical practice, and therefore did not seem to increase the incidence of UVJ obstruction.
29885870|ab|24|29885870|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|High reflux grade, presence of obstructive/refluxing megaureter and inflamed bladder mucosa were the only statistically significant and independent predictive factors for UVJ obstruction following endoscopic correction of VUR.
29949128|ab|1|29949128|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To identify the effect of duration of weight-bearing exercise and team sports participation on bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition among adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN).
29949128|ab|2|29949128|METHOD|METHODS|METHODS|We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records of all patients 9-20 years old with a DSM-5 diagnosis of AN evaluated by the Stanford Eating Disorders Program (1997-2011) who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
29949128|ab|3|29949128|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A total of 188 adolescents with AN were included (178 females and 10 males).
29949128|ab|4|29949128|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Using multivariate linear regression, duration of weight-bearing exercise (B = 0.15, p = 0.005) and participation in team sports (B = 0.53, p = 0.001) were associated with higher BMD at the hip and team sports (B = 0.39, p = 0.006) were associated with higher whole body BMC, controlling for covariates.
29949128|ab|5|29949128|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Participation in team sports (B = - 1.06, p = 0.007) was associated with greater deficits in FMI Z-score.
29949128|ab|6|29949128|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|LBMI Z-score was positively associated with duration of weight-bearing exercise (B = 0.10, p = 0.018) and may explain the relationship between exercise and bone outcomes.
29949128|ab|7|29949128|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Duration of weight-bearing exercise and team sports participation may be protective of BMD at the hip and whole body BMC, while participation in team sports was associated with greater FMI deficits among adolescents with AN.

23785119|ab|1|23785119||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are glycolipid-specific innate lymphocytes emerging as critical players in the immune response to diverse infections and disease.
23785119|ab|2|23785119||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|iNKT cells are activated through cognate interactions with lipid-loaded APCs, by Ag-independent cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, or a combination of both.
23785119|ab|3|23785119||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Although each of these modes of iNKT cell activation plays an important role in directing the humoral and cell-mediated immune response, the spatio-temporal nature of these interactions and the cellular requirements for activation are largely undefined.
23785119|ab|4|23785119||RESULTS|METHODS|Combining novel in situ confocal imaging of alphaGalactosylceramide-loaded CD1d tetramer labeling to localize the endogenous iNKT cell population with cytokine reporter mice, we reveal the choreography of early murine splenic iNKT cell activation across diverse settings of glycolipid immunization and systemic infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae.
23785119|ab|5|23785119||RESULTS|RESULTS|We find that iNKT cells consolidate in the marginal zone and require dendritic cells lining the splenic marginal zone for activation following administration of cognate glycolipids and during systemic infection but not following exogenous cytokine administration.
23785119|ab|6|23785119||RESULTS|RESULTS|Although further establishing the importance of cognate iNKT cell interactions with APCs, we also show that noncognate iNKT-dependent mechanisms are sufficient to mediate effector outcomes, such as STAT signaling and dendritic cell licensing throughout the splenic parenchyma.
23785119|ab|7|23785119||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Collectively, these data provide new insight into how iNKT cells may serve as a natural adjuvant in facilitating adaptive immune responses, irrespective of their tissue localization.
29947230|ab|1|29947230|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Eisenmenger syndrome represents severe, irreversible, and end-stage pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with congenital heart defects.
29947230|ab|2|29947230|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|For long-term outcome optimal right ventricular (RV) adaptation is crucial with precise assessment of its hypertrophy, dilatation and function.
29947230|ab|3|29947230|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Associations of electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic (ECHO) RV characteristics were analyzed.
29947230|ab|4|29947230|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Included were 52 patients (39F/13M), median age 45 years (24-78).
29947230|ab|5|29947230|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Following ECG parameters were analyzed: Butler-Leggett formula (B-L), Sokolow-Lyon criterion (S-L), QRS duration (QRS), maximum spatial QRS vector magnitude (QRS max); and ECHO parameters: RV diameter (RVd), RV wall thickness (RVAW), RV/LV function.
29947230|ab|6|29947230|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Following significant ECG-ECHO associations were demonstrated: S-L criterion and B-L formula with RVAW (p 120 ms only with severely dilated RV (RVd > 45 mm), while QRS max 33 mm); A new combined scoring system was introduced.
29947230|ab|7|29947230|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|In Eisenmenger syndrome RV hypertrophy is compensatory; diagnosis of prognostically unfavorable RV dilatation is therefore important.
29947230|ab|8|29947230|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Combined ECG-ECHO analysis enables more accurate risk stratification.
29947230|ab|9|29947230|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|QRS duration > 120 ms seems to be a late marker; QRS max together with ECHO parameters may help to distinguish patients at higher risk for clinical deterioration (Tab. 3, Fig. 8, Ref. 53).
29926916|ab|1|29926916|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In the 2009 National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Australian Guidelines to Reduce Health Risks from Drinking, a guideline specific to lactating women was included.
29926916|ab|2|29926916|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|For the first time the effect of alcohol at this important developmental stage was nationally and internationally acknowledged.
29926916|ab|3|29926916|AIMS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|To determine the degree to which maternal health practitioners adopted an Australian national policy guideline (Guideline 4B) on alcohol and breastfeeding into their everyday health practice and the factors associated with adoption.
29926916|ab|4|29926916|MATERIALS AND METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|A convenience sample of participants completed an online survey based on the Nursing Practice Questionnaire (NPQ) to elicit measures of knowledge, awareness and practice implementation.
29926916|ab|5|29926916|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|In total, 240 maternal health practitioners completed the online survey.
29926916|ab|6|29926916|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|All statistical analyses clearly indicated a higher adoption of Guideline 4B by the child health nurses, midwives and general practitioners (GPs) than was the case for paediatricians and obstetricians.
29926916|ab|7|29926916|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|A mean adoption score (range 0-4) indicative of 'some' practice implementation of 3.13, 3.04 and 2.73 was obtained by child health nurses, midwives and GPs, respectively.
29926916|ab|8|29926916|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Obstetricians and paediatricians scored a mean of 2.0, indicating they remain to be 'persuaded about the practice' of incorporating discussions around alcohol and breastfeeding into their practice.
29926916|ab|9|29926916|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Despite the existence of a national alcohol guideline for breastfeeding women, maternal health practitioners are not incorporating this advice into their everyday practice with lactating women.
29926916|ab|10|29926916|CONCLUSION|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Opportunities exist for all maternal practitioners along the reproductive continuum to protect long-term breastfeeding duration using an evidence-based harm minimisation approach to alcohol consumption.
27147132|ab|1|27147132||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Nurses play a key role in the provision of services in relation to sexuality in both primary and sexual and reproductive health-care.
27147132|ab|2|27147132||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|Given the intersection of sexualities with a range of social injustices, this study reviews research on nursing practice concerning sexuality from an emancipatory/social justice perspective.
27147132|ab|3|27147132||METHODS|METHODS|A systematic review of English articles published in nursing journals appearing on the Web of Science database from 2009 to 2014 was conducted.
27147132|ab|4|27147132||METHODS|METHODS|Thirty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria.
27147132|ab|5|27147132||METHODS|METHODS|Analysis consisted of a descriptive phase (types and location of studies, aspects of sexualities focused on, target health users and aspects of nursing practice focused on) and a critical/emancipatory phase.
27147132|ab|6|27147132||RESULTS|RESULTS|In terms of practice, our analysis revealed that: barriers exist to the integration of issues relating to sexuality in nursing practice; the social location of nurses and their personal feelings regarding sexuality influence their practice; content that addresses gendered norms and media that assist in communication underpin some emancipatory practices.
27147132|ab|7|27147132||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Few studies locate analyses of nursing practice within gendered, cultural and social norms; consider advocacy as part of the practice of nurses; or analyse the promotion of health user participation in health services and structures.
27147132|ab|8|27147132||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|The implications for emancipatory practice are drawn out.
29909877|ab|1|29909877|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Empirical evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness estimates of particular health care technologies may be limited, or it may even be missing entirely.
29909877|ab|2|29909877|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|In these situations, additional information, often in the form of expert judgments, is needed to reach a decision.
29909877|ab|3|29909877|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|There are formal methods to quantify experts' beliefs, termed as structured expert elicitation (SEE), but only limited research is available in support of methodological choices.
29909877|ab|4|29909877|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Perhaps as a consequence, the use of SEE in the context of cost-effectiveness modelling is limited.
29909877|ab|5|29909877|OBJECTIVES|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This article reviews applications of SEE in cost-effectiveness modelling with the aim of summarizing the basis for methodological choices made in each application and recording the difficulties and challenges reported by the authors in the design, conduct, and analyses.
29909877|ab|6|29909877|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|The methods used in each application were extracted along with the criteria used to support methodological and practical choices and any issues or challenges discussed in the text.
29909877|ab|7|29909877|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Issues and challenges were extracted using an open field, and then categorised and grouped for reporting.
29909877|ab|8|29909877|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The review demonstrates considerable heterogeneity in methods used, and authors acknowledge great methodological uncertainty in justifying their choices.
29909877|ab|9|29909877|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Specificities of the context area emerging as potentially important in determining further methodological research in elicitation are between- expert variation and its interpretation, the fact that substantive experts in the area may not be trained in quantitative subjects, that judgments are often needed on various parameter types, the need for some form of assessment of validity, and the need for more integration with behavioural research to devise relevant debiasing strategies.
29909877|ab|10|29909877|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|This review of experiences of SEE highlights a number of specificities/constraints that can shape the development of guidance and target future research efforts in this area.
26984266|ab|1|26984266||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Kaempferol is a member of the flavonoid compounds found in vegetables and fruits.
26984266|ab|2|26984266||BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|It is shown to exhibit biological impact and anticancer activity, but no report exists on the angiogenic effect of kaempferol and induction of cell apoptosis in vitro.
26984266|ab|3|26984266||OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|In this study, we investigated the role of kaempferol on anti-angiogenic property and the apoptotic mechanism of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
26984266|ab|4|26984266||RESULTS|RESULTS|Our results demonstrated that kaempferol decreased HUVEC viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
26984266|ab|5|26984266||RESULTS|RESULTS|Kaempferol also induced morphological changes and sub-G1 phase cell population (apoptotic cells).
26984266|ab|6|26984266||RESULTS|RESULTS|Kaempferol triggered apoptosis of HUVECs as detecting by DNA fragmentation, comet assay and immunofluorescent staining for activated caspase-3.
26984266|ab|7|26984266||RESULTS|RESULTS|The caspase signals, including caspase-8, -9 and -3, were time-dependently activated in HUVECs after kaempferol exposure.
26984266|ab|8|26984266||RESULTS|RESULTS|Furthermore, pre-treatment with a specific inhibitor of caspase-8 (Z-IETD-FMK) significantly reduced the activity of caspase-8, -9 and -3, indicating that extrinsic pathway is a major signaling pathway in kaempferol-treated HUVECs.
26984266|ab|9|26984266||RESULTS|RESULTS|Importantly, kaempferol promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) evaluated using flow cytometric assay in HUVECs.
26984266|ab|10|26984266||RESULTS|RESULTS|We further investigated the upstream extrinsic pathway and showed that kaempferol stimulated death receptor signals [Fas/CD95, death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5] through increasing the levels of phosphorylated p53 and phosphorylated ATM pathways in HUVECs, which can be individually confirmed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), ATM specific inhibitor (caffeine) and p53 siRNA.
26984266|ab|11|26984266||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Based on these results, kaempferol-induced HUVEC apoptosis was involved in an ROS-mediated p53/ATM/death receptor signaling.
26984266|ab|12|26984266||CONCLUSIONS|CONCLUSIONS|Kaempferol might possess therapeutic effects on cancer treatment in anti-vascular targeting.

29957866|ab|2|29957866|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|BACKGROUND|Armed Forces' training and deployment have greatly increased, escalating the risk of injury and pain-related issues both at home station and deployment environments.
29957866|ab|3|29957866|AIMS|OBJECTIVE|OBJECTIVE|This integrative review examines the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors for musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and headaches in active duty (AD) military populations.
29957866|ab|4|29957866|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Peer-reviewed research published between 2001 and 2016 was identified relevant to MSP and headache in AD military personnel using MeSH terms in key biomedical databases.
29957866|ab|5|29957866|METHODS|METHODS|METHODS|Inclusion criteria were: epidemiological studies examining MSP or headache as primary or secondary outcome; samples that included AD populations; and studies conducted in the theater of operations, at home station, and in military treatment or Veterans Health Administration facilities.
29957866|ab|6|29957866|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Twenty-six articles met inclusion criteria.
29957866|ab|7|29957866|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Low back pain (LBP) was the most prevalent MSP diagnosis.
29957866|ab|8|29957866|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The incidence of LBP was 40.5 per 1,000 person-years and was comparable to nonmilitary populations.
29957866|ab|9|29957866|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Inflammation and pain from overuse comprised the largest proportion of injury mechanism, accounting for about 82% of all injuries among nondeployed military personnel.
29957866|ab|10|29957866|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|The risk of MSP was greater for AD, female, Army, enlisted personnel, and those with greater time in a motor vehicle.
29957866|ab|11|29957866|RESULTS|RESULTS|RESULTS|Evidence suggests posttraumatic headache, occurring in up to 92% of military personnel who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury, is associated with chronic daily headaches.
